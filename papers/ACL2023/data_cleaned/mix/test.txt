paid for it what can be better	64 63 63 63 63 63 63
on camera actor can do	72 72 72 64 64
physical stuff but obviously I think	63 63 36 63 24 24
to explain is what i mean by	64 25 40 64 64 64 24
at what doesn ' t isn ' t necessary and then	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

driving by	0 0
instagram and get a bunch of praise for	63 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
for a credit card of your own what you	64 64 64 64 64 64 56 56 56
told a story as actors we are	64 56 56 56 64 63 56
something like code school or code	30 20 30 0 0 28
until next time keep practicing keep	63 63 64 64 64 56
casting directors will be having trouble	63 63 72 72 72 72
this 500 000 property is a fourplex	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
take this seriously	64 64 64
business works and how you as the actor	56 56 56 56 56 63 72 63
you are now	63 63 36
you will pass the test your first try	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
right here without any ugly cool	0 0 0 0 56 63
Brandon anywhere and then if you could	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
these factors we have very little	0 0 0 0 0 0
actors and then you would tell facebook	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is that there ' s no upfront mortgage	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
friends and through your family as long	56 56 56 56 56 32 56
don ' t want to over renovate ideally	56 56 56 56 56 56 49 49
choosing to do a solo 401k	36 56 56 32 35 49
it showcases more of your acting	63 36 72 72 72 63
it ' s just like what I ' m doing in here	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
place so right now i do have	63 63 63 63 64 64 63
life purpose	64 64
you simply because	0 0 0
marvel movies and netflix shows as stunt	56 72 63 63 63 63 63
so i hope all that makes sense in terms	72 45 72 72 72 64 64 72 72
are two	63 63
agent to sell their first home and this	56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63
you can teach it in a compelling an	64 64 64 72 72 64 64 72
I put them side - by - side the headshot	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
main ones that i like to look at	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 63
we ' ve seen prices skyrocket in the last	72 72 72 64 56 72 72 72 72
of needing all of the script to needing	56 56 64 64 64 64 64 64
if you are interested in voice acting	72 64 64 64 64 64 63
i don ' t know what it ' s like in other	36 36 36 36 63 72 64 64 64 64 64 64
per se but i do think they are overrated	64 64 64 64 64 56 56 64 64
to value that is your borrowing 80 % of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a good income	63 63 63
have those people around you who are	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
many years to see success in real estate	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
lead or a supporting character	0 0 0 0 0
to teach that working with a scene	64 64 32 32 63 56 56
and demo reels	56 63 24
you should be paying who ' s legitimate	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
then it ' s definitely okay to [UNK]	56 56 56 56 56 49 49 56
won ' t go over in this video but to make	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 42 63 63
it becomes pretty dangerous because no	63 63 63 63 63 63
an equity member for theater that	0 0 0 0 0 0
explosion is your eyeline for that so	36 36 36 36 63 63 63
there ' s so much to learn and this is a	64 64 64 64 64 64 56 56 56 56 64
to earn the money to buy the thing and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 36
they reveal it	64 64 64
learn before you get on to a higher	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
want to pursue a career in american	72 72 72 72 72 64 64
buying photo paper for headshots is that	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
way to house hack and i know a lot of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72
my career has come in the last five	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
audition for the casting director	63 63 63 64 63
necessarily true story and generic brand	63 63 63 63 63 63
effectively remember that	64 64 64
it that is what works for you so you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
running the line so you ' re gonna do this	64 64 63 63 32 32 32 56 56 56
what is one of the biggest lessons that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they stain really easily a kitchen	63 63 63 63 63 63
on - camera actor you can do a movie you	63 63 63 32 56 56 56 32 56 56
so if you happen to have the skill or	56 64 64 64 56 56 56 64 56
about about this one thing and the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
mortgage insurance then you know so many	64 63 56 63 63 63 63
them to say you know what you may not be	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
taxed as a sole proprietorship however	56 32 32 32 56 56
and and seeing that on a resume so if	56 56 64 64 64 64 72 72
on your side	63 63 63
the casting process sometimes those	63 63 63 63 56
a film and television resume so if you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

to tax you on up to 250 000	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
makes you look	0 0 0
and those people who doubt you it ' s okay	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
for my own exams if you ' re watching this	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56 56
definitely scrape those off repaint it	63 63 63 63 63 63

whenever you go into an audition by the	72 72 72 72 72 72 45 36
the tax code is complicated but the	56 63 56 56 42 42 63

the good news is you don ' t have to spend	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
that only i can do and the only thing	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
these are the things that i did a ton of	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 72
years ago I was in London for work so	64 72 72 63 63 63 63 56 63

down in the comments below	64 64 64 64 48
before I close my eyes and actually try	24 24 24 24 24 24 63 63
standpoint exactly why they ' re giving	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
step by step and section by section so	36 36 63 36 36 63 63 36
getting that audition and doing it was a	56 56 56 63 63 63 63 63
super important and so for me investing	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
this place is like upwork and fiber that	24 48 48 48 48 42 48 48
set the chart down and then	63 63 63 63 63 63
and also please please please	72 64 64 64 64
career earlier	63 63
mean I was definitely caught off guard a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
be taken	64 64
it even if you don ' t book	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
having visual distractions well we	56 63 56 32 64
income legally then make sure to	56 56 56 56 56 56
in your income this literally happened	63 63 56 56 63 63
all the amazing tax benefits that come	32 63 63 56 63 63 63
wrong in fact he made it all the way to	63 63 63 8 8 8 36 63 63 63
that ' s how you join the union and stay	64 64 64 64 64 64 63 64 64 64
estate agent the next step is buying	63 63 63 63 63 64 63
since the very beginning and i ' ve had	63 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 63
a scenario for you to act out	32 56 56 56 56 63 72
so then i didn ' t hear anything for two	45 63 63 45 45 45 40 64 64 64
self - helpy but actually it ' s it ' s a very	63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
investing is through rental income and	64 64 56 72 72 64
really scale to seven figures and beyond	56 56 56 63 63 63 63
i think in that respect background work	64 64 56 64 64 72 72
about acting when they asked you tell me	64 64 64 64 72 64 64 64
million dollars because people the real	63 63 63 63 63 63
because that takes away from me	63 63 56 63 63 63
start an acting career	64 64 64 56
did was we took dusk photos and dust	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
ergonomic handle or the Badger hair	32 32 56 56 56 56
home now i ' m not saying like never get	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64 63
best bet this is because if you want to	64 64 63 56 63 56 56 56 56
10 plus years all right that ' s it for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64
the tenth and final way that we ' re going	63 64 64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
three column format now i ' m going to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and schedule showings before our actual	63 63 63 63 63 63
an agent and one of the most important	63 63 63 63 72 63 63 63
seriously want to pursue a career in	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
I think all of us can think of things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that has like dim lighting that is dark	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
is once that final decision is made the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
switching from your name is worn so many	0 0 0 0 20 25 56 56
investment property so here you can see	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
getting that experience	63 63 63
self - employed you need to have tax	56 56 56 56 56 35 35 35
rehearsal rehearsals up and action I	9 9 9 9 45 72
alright that ' s it for this video	63 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
up for success there are so many	64 64 64 72 72 72 72
laminate or a luxury vinyl these are	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
because your real estate agent is gonna	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
life that threaten to steal our money	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
cutting off half our heads you	64 64 64 64 64 40
those all start to add credits to your	32 56 56 56 64 64 64 64
it can be crazy scary to do something	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
of people that receive an audition then	72 72 72 72 63 63 63
oftentimes what you ' re really gaining	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
you don ' t want your first ever acting	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

first of all congratulations but don	64 64 64 64 64 64

have the name of the	0 0 0 0 0
single week today we ' re talking about	0 4 4 64 64 64 56 56
know why you ' re being asked that tell me	64 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 63 63
and a self taped audition what should	56 56 56 56 64 63 63
the major cities in the united states	63 63 72 64 64 64 72
video if you liked it please give me a	64 64 64 40 40 40 40 40 64
and it certainly is the case for	63 63 56 56 56 56 56
that ' s probably not the best use of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 63
to the area and they should be an expert	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
submit to an agent and they	63 63 64 64 64 64
real estate investing for example how	72 72 72 63 72 64

that and then just spending maybe a few	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
such as asana and notion that help you	64 64 64 56 56 56 63 63

share with you the story	64 64 64 64 64
get a dog okay so in an audition like	63 63 63 63 64 64 64 64 64

and I think you will as well I ' ve put	63 36 36 63 63 63 63 36 36 36 36
remember when I got there there was	56 32 32 56 56 63 63
totally different story	56 56 56
the whole	72 72
a self tape and it was almost all improv	64 56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64
so so I think this video what I wanted	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

what might come up right just in case	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56

theater you ' ll have	0 0 0 0 0

making money in real estate works	64 64 64 64 64 56
and put it on their scene partner to	30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30

book your first few auditions that has	36 36 36 36 36 72 63
connections you have in the industry	63 63 63 63 63 63
meet that potential tenant face to face	49 49 56 56 56 56 63
my computer and I see a file named	63 63 63 63 72 72 72 72
and done it and this is not like doing	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
should be the max amount of money you	20 64 64 56 56 56 56 64
and this has a lot to do with	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you know how it works	56 56 56 64 64
going to pay for headshots how am i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
agent well those people are getting way	63 63 63 56 56 56 56
those are the ones that you should get i	63 63 56 64 56 56 56 56 64
a really established entrepreneur now	56 64 64 56 56
will be booked off of the initial	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
when you start working with an agent	64 72 72 64 64 64 64
other ways to do lead generation we are	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the teams that are competing	64 63 72 64 64
sometimes that ' s just going to be a	63 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
so i ' ve been a working actor for almost	64 64 64 64 72 63 63 63 63 63
to the camera a little bit more	63 63 63 63 56 32 20
that you don ' t have a lot of room to	15 15 15 15 15 15 15 63 63 63 63
or a DVD or whatever that has a bunch of	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
spot a phony the rule of thumb here is	64 64 64 63 63 63 63 63 63
anything there ' s no like actual reason	56 56 56 56 63 63 63 56
that so we as actors we need to stop	63 63 64 64 64 72 72 72 64
know how to run the numbers so why do we	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63
they do	64 64
annual operating expenses so these are	0 0 0 0 0 0
practicing keep	36 63
back to the original question of	63 63 63 63 63 63
course after a couple seconds I	56 64 64 64 64 64
longer than you expect but the more that	63 63 64 64 64 64 64 64
classes and your phone without you can	56 64 64 63 63 63 72
less than that so if you are in the	72 63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
when you invest more that means more of	63 63 63 63 63 56 56 56

that you ' re able to support yourself and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
auditioning for a project	64 64 64 56

and it ' s crazy to think that the course	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
20 of the most common terms that you	63 45 64 64 64 64 64 64
and the other half are union states	72 72 72 72 72 63 63
interacting with another human being	63 63 63 64 64
about the types of credits	72 72 72 72 72
think of your brain as a tool that can	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
sure but not everybody needs to look	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so we ' re making fifty pounds without	63 56 56 56 56 32 36 36
much more theater when i was just	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you could be sweeping the floor you can	56 56 63 36 36 36 72 72
before you submit it to the agent so now	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56 63
telling me that you saw me	64 64 64 64 64 64
and it ' s a popular one and that is the	64 64 64 64 64 40 40 64 64 64 64
your upfront mortgage insurance premium	0 0 0 0 0
you enjoyed this video and i ' ll see you	63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
i said working in class	63 63 63 63 63
um being organized with things and	63 63 63 63 63 63
selling merch but it ' s it ' s kind of hard	42 42 63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
doesn ' t sign you and the reason is	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
type of situation where it might be	56 56 64 56 56 56 56
are 300 actors auditioning for it well	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
this video let me briefly mention some	64 64 64 56 64 64 64
is when you rent out part of your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the right location matters	36 36 36 56
but there are steps before and after the	20 35 56 56 56 72 72 72
for a television show the final decision	63 63 63 63 56 56 56
to make a career out of this	64 64 64 64 64 64 63
in order to safely buy a home	64 64 56 56 64 64 64
probably because they had been working	64 63 63 63 63 63
saying oh i ' m a really good actor i want	56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64 64 64 56
a lot of people think so because that	63 63 63 63 72 72 72 72
what ' s up my fellow actors welcome to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
has to be for a demo real purposes the	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
want to do in order to gain the most	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
from actingcareercenter	63 63
trying to I ' m not used I don ' t use your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for where i moved	63 63 63 63
year they quit they go back to their	63 56 56 56 63 72 63 63
seen lots of people transform those	63 63 63 63 63 63
and that ' s not the correct term the	56 56 56 56 64 64 56 56 56
and you can spend it doing a lot more	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
much as possible so having workflows for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
perform some shows will feel a lot	56 56 64 64 64 64 64
photography business uh online courses	63 63 42 42 42
photo paper this is different from	63 63 63 35 56 35
you you ' ll see a lot of your friends	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
that ' s the steps that you have to take	72 72 72 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
in filmmaking it ' s happened to me before	56 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
for you to go full time because the last	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

a few years ago and that ' s on your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and i want to tell you guys that i don	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
let ' s say you buy a property for three	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
process by yourself the more that you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they want to see a professional headshot	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
even though I live in Ohio I ' ve been	64 64 64 64 56 56 56 56 56 63
or fatigue or overall exhaustion that	0 0 0 0 0 0
thousands of students apply for	56 56 56 56 56
pieces come together so people know who	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
don ' t apply in right to work states in	63 63 63 63 63 63 72 72 72 72
like they waited until the very last	48 48 48 48 48 72 72
casting process so if we don ' t have	64 64 56 32 32 32 32 32 56
spending some time with you today if you	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 45

personally have dealt with that without	0 0 0 0 0 0
scene and not just the lines now you	32 63 72 45 72 0 36 36
well if it ' s gonna go up or not and how	0 0 64 64 64 64 0 0 0 63 63 63

in the next one	56 56 0 0
that ' s another important part about the	56 56 56 56 64 64 56 56
beneficial to a lot of people so if	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the question was	72 63 63
a zero cost of maintenance as well all	63 63 63 24 56 56 32 32
actually in line with what we say we	63 63 56 63 63 63 63 63

if you ' re in college look for theater	63 63 63 63 63 63 72 72 72

keep going to acting class in your	64 63 56 56 64 64 64
it ' s going to be life - changing for so	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
less than one percent of my auditions	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
eating I like to call them lifestyles	0 0 0 0 0 0 0

do with this part of setting is refresh	42 63 63 63 63 63 64 56
i find that they have accurate questions	64 42 63 63 63 64 0
across the country	48 72 72
here they have a little spot where you	81 81 72 81 72 72 72 72
the class and you ' ve liked absorb the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

here you would write your character this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
instead of needing you here in atlanta	72 72 48 56 56 56 56
on these things because that ' s what ' s	72 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it comes to investing you want to remove	56 56 56 56 56 56 32 64
i ultimately decided to go ahead and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
while maintaining those expenses	63 63 63 63
every time you audition	63 63 63 63
different ways that actors make money	63 63 63 63 63 24
didn ' t have to work	0 0 0 0 0 0

the first thing is finances i feel like	63 63 63 63 0 0 0 0
this is an easy question to answer i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
enough so that you don ' t need to rely on	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
right so I would be spending a lot more	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
on actors who have theater experience	56 56 64 64 64 64
other side of the camera	64 64 32 64 64
is that it is not the casting director	63 63 63 56 63 63 63 63
what ' s going on but then when they	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and not very inviting I ' m not gonna	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
or you can just go directly into making	56 56 56 56 56 49 56 56
and how much you need to bring to the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

commandments let me tell you about a	63 36 36 63 63 63 64
times so i didn ' t lie to you i did not	64 64 64 40 40 40 64 56 40 40 40 40
and the money that you should have saved	56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63
city first get as much training as you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64
laughing and joking with each other in	72 72 72 64 64 64 64
to do that monologue 100 of the time	64 64 64 64 72 56 56 64
for instance it ' s possible that the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it ' s used by a company or by a business	56 56 56 56 63 72 72 63 63 63 63
big netflix show or a big marvel movie	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

square footage of your home office	16 16 16 16 16 16
they ' ve seen commercials being done and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

because 99 of the top actors	63 24 24 24 48 64
which can come in really handy sometimes	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
experience than me	56 56 36
the cabinets get some new countertops	81 63 63 63 63 63
instead of getting a degree in acting	64 64 63 63 56 63 63
i recommend just have some of these	56 56 36 36 63 63 63
work their way up right so in your	32 32 32 64 63 64 64 64
like cigarette smoke have been like	63 63 63 63 63 63

overdo your makeup and when your	63 63 63 56 56 56

finding the right actor to fill a	56 56 56 56 64 72 72
if you drive a lot of miles but you have	56 32 56 56 32 20 56 56 56 63
channel to get more videos on acting	72 72 72 72 63 63 63

you can book more or do more	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
who wants that look at the features the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
because it allows them to customize it a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
our example let ' s only focus on one	56 56 64 64 64 40 64 56 56
to have to move to one of those markets	72 64 64 72 64 64 64 72 63
and got my license from real estate	64 48 72 72 72 72 56
many people aren ' t many of you may only	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64
before making that big move because	56 56 56 56 56 56
don ' t need an agent right away in fact	63 63 63 63 63 56 64 64 56 56
UK applying to medical school taking	25 25 25 25 25 25
everyone is going to have learned	72 56 56 56 56 56
instead they ' re moving all their stuff	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
and also	63 63
good thing because it means you have	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
any movies that ever filmed in that	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
audition that are just as significant	64 64 56 72 72 72
of your income and you ' re not really the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72
and still do extremely well on your	64 64 64 48 63 48 63
this we are almost always doing	63 64 64 63 63 63
forward to seeing you on set one day	63 63 63 63 63 63 0 0
character you know we ' re gonna be on	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
write off you can even write off your	16 56 63 36 36 36 63 56
either but i booked the room again so	36 63 36 63 63 63 72 72
what loan program is right for you now i	56 56 56 56 56 56 63 56 64
then there are going to be some	63 63 63 63 56 56 64
think about product - based businesses	64 72 64 64 64 64
number one is to follow the audition	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
but i ' m not holding my breath and here	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
when they find out they didn ' t book	63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
and new roles and you know it was one of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
obviously this isn ' t an overnight thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you have to make sure to pay that off	64 64 64 64 56 56 64 56 63
afford what they ' re gonna do is they	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and being a personal assistant and admin	63 42 24 24 32 56 56
lot of us really struggle with this	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
like a sounding board for ideas i have	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
make sure you ' re automating things as	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
couple casting directors have to say	63 63 63 56 64 64
cold calling other days you ' ll be	56 56 56 63 56 56 56 56
it would be a good idea to wear	64 64 63 63 63 63 63 63
all these different things that a lot of	20 20 20 20 20 16 20 16
refer to either a project breakdown or a	63 56 64 64 64 63 63 63
therefore they ' re standing closer to the	36 36 36 36 36 63 63 63
days prior to prepare that audition	72 72 72 72 36 63
conflict and relationships and	63 24 56 72
of whether or not you should join when	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
you ' re trying to buy a type of meat	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
over a hundred thousand dollars	63 63 63 63 63
percentage over the hundreds and	63 72 63 63 63
you look at it over a whole year that	56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
it takes a lot of time and effort and	0 0 0 0 63 63 63 63 63
the number one thing to remember when	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
to create your demo reel for you	63 63 64 64 64 64 64
say is when you are investing in	56 56 56 64 64 56 72
love with her and animals world with an	64 64 64 64 63 64 64 64

shinier look now this is really your	36 64 40 72 64 64 40
then using the actual expenses method is	56 20 32 56 56 56 56
to start owning real estate and building	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
slowly stop doing your other jobs and	32 56 56 56 56 56 63
an FHA loan then your credit score only	56 63 63 56 56 56 56 56

your acting career and i think that ' s an	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
getting hit with a huge bill	63 63 56 63 63 56
director there ' s an acting teacher here	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
all of those rules whereas union	56 56 56 63 72 72
doctor on that show and i ' m in episode	56 56 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 72
with a lot of production as well like	64 64 64 64 72 63 63 63
and that it comes from something else	63 63 63 56 56 56 56
two or more years the irs is not going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the least amount of money I know lots of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
director then takes that script	63 56 56 56 63
and whereas for union productions you	72 72 64 64 64 64
else in different state then the basic	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
in mind what i think about all the time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
much sense to invest fifty grand into	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it too so if you want to learn more	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
room we can ' t control whether or not we	63 32 32 32 32 32 56 56 56 56
start auditioning for things without	64 64 63 63 63
safe at work	63 56 56

then the night before	63 63 63 64
your own hours and do whatever you want	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
really sounds like it would be	0 0 0 0 0 0
or are you gonna rather prefer paying	56 63 63 63 56 56 63
full of	63 9
commercial so they might say here ' s the	36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 63

you can start small with your own home	56 56 63 72 63 63 63 64
because there were no tv shows and	72 72 72 72 72 64 72
free to leave them down	64 64 64 64 64
the audition was for	63 56 56 63
on the older generations as well	63 63 63 63 63 63
so that they could stay on schedule so	56 56 56 56 64 64 63 56

now i want to emphasize again that if	63 63 64 64 64 32 36 36
three dollars a month of storage as well	48 72 72 72 72 56 56 56
really easy to understand manner and it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
well you mentioned results and it ' s you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

that i think a lot of you guys need to	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 63
work for them if you look at the numbers	63 56 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
i think i auditioned two or three times	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and to redo it and find out but a lot of	56 63 63 63 64 64 64 25 25 64 64

an audition and I did get the sites	63 63 63 63 64 72 72 72
why do you need an agent then if you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72
like that so we need to strengthen and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after a member in which case you would	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it ' s actually due because you don ' t know	56 56 56 64 63 63 30 63 63 63 63
that is currently on the air then you	64 64 64 64 64 72 72 72
just having this swinging down by my	56 56 56 56 63 63 56
you gotta know how to really control	63 72 72 72 64 64 40
series regular lead supporting principal	0 0 0 0 0
after speaking with your lender and real	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
so what I ' m trying to do is to make sure	63 56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
now that we have the mortgage stuff out	64 56 64 64 64 64 64 64
there are so many things that you can	16 16 16 63 56 56 56 56

outside of the classroom never from an	64 64 64 64 64 40 63

the tenants you are officially a	63 63 63 63 63 63
but i really wanted to pinpoint it here	72 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
about how	63 63
to answer based on your own life but I	64 64 64 63 63 63 64 64 63
work laws you really need to look at	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
in hollywood are all union members	64 64 72 72 72 72
on our side for example people who	56 56 56 56 56 63 63

where you live let ' s say you buy a home	63 63 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is that really worth it on that note one	63 56 56 56 63 63 63 63 63
it is very important to take into	64 64 64 64 64 64 72
the molding and the trims choose maybe a	72 72 45 45 45 63 63 63
confidence that you ' re the right person	64 64 64 64 64 40 64 64
then brings back	36 63 64
high because they ' re not going to spend	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

i guarantee you it ' s gonna taste exactly	64 56 56 56 56 56 56 63 56
our colleagues can give a nod to if we	81 64 0 0 0 0 42 42 63
so if this is something that you	64 63 63 63 63 63 63
because you ' re thinking about investing	49 56 56 56 56 56 56
this spot by just reviewing his initial	63 63 63 72 72 72 64
actually the conventional loan and many	56 56 64 64 64 63
my take when it comes to using props	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
you guys have not yet signed up for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
maybe 70 80 bucks so you ' re paying that	56 63 63 63 56 63 63 63 63 63
brands and that is a product conflict	63 64 64 64 64 64 63
it ' s a union project that check ' s gonna	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
now i ' ve talked about actor finances	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
outside the house in Los Angeles that I	63 63 72 63 63 63 72 72
to get up at 5 a . m . and other days you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
know three to five percent is pretty	63 63 63 63 63 63 64
and that ' s the first thing that they ask	72 72 72 72 72 63 63 63 63 63
want to be able to have a track record	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
these lines five or ten times right	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
do it yourself what I ' ll do is choose	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
multiple projects	36 63
instagram so we chat a lot about that so	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
try to create a separate entrance as	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
of and a software product online and	24 24 72 72 72 72 48
getting an agent is down the line but	72 72 36 36 9 36 36 63
referring to movies when they say take 1	56 56 56 63 56 56 56 56
right for this particular role but we	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
another thing that really sucks about	63 63 56 56 56 56
of acting because that ' s how you	64 64 56 63 63 63 63 63
new videos soon and i can ' t share more	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
is what it takes to become a	63 63 72 72 72 72 72
hundreds of dollars per year just simply	56 56 63 56 56 56 56
percent of the people on your email list	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you ' re welcome so I see you at the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
for some amazing projects so	63 63 63 63 63
things that people will pay you for some	72 72 72 72 63 63 24 63
different from regular printer paper	42 42 63 63 63
decided that I wanted to be a super nerd	24 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 36
doctor to walk in and then	63 63 63 63 63 63
to do a short - term rental on airbnb for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
that you got these things on sale you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
go to your favorite store and find that	56 64 64 63 63 56 56 56
things were laid out or things were	63 63 72 72 72 63 63
channel if you haven ' t already	64 56 56 56 56 56 63
credit score so the higher credit score	56 56 63 56 56 56 56
of investment properties so here are	64 72 64 56 56 56
a bigger pool of potential buyers later	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it has to do with whether or not you can	72 72 72 72 56 56 56 56 63 63
now this can cost anywhere between i	64 56 56 56 56 63 63
instructions oftentimes when you get a	64 63 56 64 64 64
that ' s something that you want to pursue	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 63
conventional loan they ' re going to	56 56 63 63 63 56 56
but in in my experience that ' s like	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
audition I mentioned earlier then I will	63 56 64 64 64 63 63
emotions that they want to convey in	10 10 10 56 56 56 56
and not only look for	56 56 56 56 56
learn more about self - taping i actually	72 72 63 63 63 63 72 72
i would not be where i am today so you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and the reason why it ' s so important is	64 56 56 64 56 56 56 64 64 56
provide for themselves and for their	64 64 64 64 64 64
new marvel movie they won ' t tell you	36 36 36 64 64 64 64 64 64

fortunately self - taping is not rocket	64 64 64 64 64 64 64

that could throw them off right then and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the step step where the last day on	64 64 64 56 64 64 64 64
live in one of them and rent out the	56 56 56 49 56 56 56 63 63

some handholding but that is	64 64 64 56 56
I went to play football in basketball at	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but they really do add up when you	72 64 56 56 56 56 56 56
up to a whopping	56 56 56 56
you should probably have a home office	20 16 16 20 16 49 56
a self tape as a demo rather when you	40 63 63 63 63 56 63 36 36

hey if it works for an Oscar winner it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
as soon as i moved to atlanta my first	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

great for your career because not only	56 64 64 56 56 56 56
explodes if you ' re seeing that it	63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
all the way to the end	64 72 72 63 63 63
takes a lot of time to maintain so	63 56 56 56 56 56 63 56
that I learned and	64 63 63 63
set because they have that experience	63 63 63 63 63 63
area that the house is in because you	49 49 56 49 49 49 49 49
can just kind of browse through all the	48 48 48 48 48 72 72 48
because when i got my first audition i	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 40
myself and	63 64
just like looking at the scale every day	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
not a lot of film and television	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
we ' re lucky enough to be doing a job	4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 72 72
being specific about what exactly it is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i make a ton of content about personal	25 25 0 25 25 25 25 25
and it ' s possible that they simply have	72 72 72 72 63 64 64 64 64
an agent is to attend casting director	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
whole story	64 40
for a caucasian character but then they	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
performers in	56 56
the producers so that now they gave me	63 63 63 63 63 63 64 72
even college a lot of those places may	72 72 72 72 64 64 64 64
tight that you can really just stand in	63 63 63 72 72 72 64 64
you work background	64 64 64
going to overpower yours and it ' s gonna	72 72 63 63 72 72 72 72 72

talk about the difference between	64 64 64 64 64
talking to Tyler during this interview	63 63 63 63 63 63
places that you know I might not focus	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
practicing keep learning and i hope to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and i want to separate that question	36 36 45 45 63 63 63
start to	64 64
everything like that	56 56 56
wear something that ' s similar to what	64 64 64 64 64 56 56 56
monthly housing payment the housing	63 63 56 63 63
actors at the moment or just female	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

them how to do well in these exams and	63 63 63 63 24 36 63 63 63
there ' s just that that ' s it like	56 56 56 56 63 56 56 56 56 56
or thousands of dollars per year if you	63 56 56 56 56 56 56 64

process of getting your real estate	63 63 63 63 63 63

rules as you ' ll ever find in your acting	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56 64
maybe I just do you know five minutes on	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
reason for that is because	63 56 56 63 63
me more money because i can focus on the	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
do rely on someone else for the majority	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
take it personally and definitely don	63 63 63 56 56 64
example you can afford a multi	56 56 56 56 56 56
if those sacrifices are worth it to you	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 45
i think that goes without saying but do	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

your audition	64 64
you ' ll meet many people and create	42 42 42 56 35 56 56 56
really this is the exact playbook would	36 63 63 45 45 24 24
it comes with the [UNK] that ' s part	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
i mean trader joe ' s has pretty good	56 56 63 56 56 56 56 63 63
so for television shows your billing is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0

automatically built in with that you	0 0 0 63 64 56
is possible to turn his liquid and	56 63 63 63 63 63 63
never from a casting director never from	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
for example let ' s say that a character	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

pros section with an open mind and just	63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
probably one hour but i just really	56 56 56 56 56 64 56
tool that lets these lenders lend out	56 56 63 63 63 56 56
can also lead to increased	56 56 56 56 56
depending on where the acting studio is	64 64 64 56 63 63 63
unless you can back it up with video	56 56 56 56 56 56 32 56
when you ' re representing yourself at the	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56
once we start thinking of money as this	63 63 63 72 72 72 63 56
to succeed in real estate you do not	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

that ' s very difficult i know of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

especially when	36 63

these are gonna be the things that you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

what does an agent want to see when you	64 64 64 64 64 63 63 63 63

easier if you have a smaller file size	63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64

or just a blank piece of paper or	63 36 63 63 63 63 56 56

state questions and they also have this	56 56 56 35 35 56 63
than waiting out having house prices	56 56 56 63 63 56
this as your career is to have	72 72 72 72 72 72 36
feet tall	32 63
dollars with just a tripod	64 64 64 64 64
but an email list is also just so	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
afford it and they ' ll make large	63 63 72 64 64 64 63 56
the chances that I will book my audition	63 63 63 63 63 56 56 56
you ' ll have a standard or	56 56 56 56 56 56 49
theater degree can be helpful but it	72 72 63 63 63 63 63
if your scenes were cut and you ' re no	63 63 63 63 63 72 63 63 63 63

so yeah if you want to get into real	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
when my eyes open and I ' m still in bed	36 36 36 63 63 63 63 63 63 72 64

that you can get on your own which are	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
market after calm and today we ' re going	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
into real estate investing because as	64 64 64 56 56 72
you time because	63 63 56
normally do but you know I ' ve shot	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that ' s doing all the types of projects	36 36 36 36 63 63 72 72 72
them down	64 64
but if you are feeling called to make	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
saying things like oh you guys you guys	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
audition time	72 72
and i definitely recommend taking	35 20 20 32 56
still getting a paycheck	63 56 56 63
whole real estate thing that ' s why I	72 81 81 63 63 63 63 56 56
start talking about what these things	64 64 64 64 56 63
then while you are in your current	64 56 56 56 56 64 64
a corporate video or an industrial video	56 56 56 56 56 56 32
told you about that client	63 63 63 63 63
furthermore in yourself because you know	0 0 0 0 0 0
some will have one round of callbacks	72 63 63 63 63 63 63
down and leaning forward to talk to the	56 64 64 64 64 56 64 64
purpose you were created in a unique way	63 63 63 63 56 63 63 63
people you how the work i could you	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 63
opportunity to get auditions for that	72 72 72 72 72 72
we don ' t have that progress in that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
of finding tenants screening them	64 42 64 56 56
agents and casting directors need to	63 63 63 63 63 63

and because of that	63 63 63 63
but i hope it gave you a clear	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
have a callback sometimes a character	56 56 56 56 56 56
about memorization techniques	56 64 64
that you plan to live in to pursue	72 64 64 64 64 64 64 63

by the way this also applies to your	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
not going to be possible and everyone	56 56 56 56 56 63 56
let ' s get started the first thing you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you have the option to put a really	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the next section is training	0 0 0 0 0
digital is it ' s better but there	24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24
the day before or the days prior because	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
reasonably straightforward to develop	24 72 72 63
most acting classes are not quite that	63 63 56 56 64 64 64
it a thumbs up if you have any questions	64 64 63 63 63 36 36 36 36
walk and exit out of frame on this side	81 81 81 81 81 81 81 72 72
an acting career	64 64 64
advertisements and things like that	63 63 63 63 64
days so you definitely don ' t have to go	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
as an artist	63 63 36
human being rather than to	63 63 36 36 36
