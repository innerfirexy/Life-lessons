thing that I see and something I	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
photos with just their phone right	72 64 64 72 72 63
these normally have a better return and	56 56 32 56 56 56 56
caught up on the education they spend a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
that actors make money within this	56 63 56 56 56 56
account and then you can put your	63 72 72 72 72 72 64
where you take two hours out of your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what ' s the difference between the two	63 63 63 72 64 64 64 56

makes it feel like your money is not	56 56 56 63 64 64 56 35
easiest way of getting people to know	48 48 42 42 63 56 56
to have the highest credit score you can	64 56 64 56 56 56 56 56
so that they can be the best that they	64 56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
budget for those as well some people	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
stabilize it on a tripod so if I were	72 72 48 30 30 18 18 18 18
your scenes get cut you still get paid	63 63 63 63 36 36 63 63
a new brand of paint brushes and in this	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64
but i really want to play in the nba so	63 56 56 56 56 64 56 56 56 56

the acting teacher and the students	56 56 64 64 64 64
some of you	72 63 63
our time is is limited and so if you	48 24 24 63 24 42 24 24 24

soft white light it wasn ' t too yellow	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
type of practice question bank this is	56 56 56 64 56 56 56
you can continue to use these strategies	36 36 72 72 72 72 72
energy will be contagious and will get	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

competitive wages and safe excellent	64 64 64 56 64

as you can see we ' re not in my normal	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 63
I am g40 five five seven jpg well that	63 63 40 72 72 72 72 63 63
it ' s so much harder in my opinion to	56 56 56 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
few decades and as a result	72 72 72 56 56 72
interest rate	56 56
simply because when i auditioned for it	63 63 36 36 63 63 63

callback what yeah whatever this movie	63 63 63 63 63 63
agents producers basically anybody in	56 56 72 63 63
um straight out of college so i kind of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
together a playlist for you right here	42 42 42 42 63 64 64

investments back so well and for me it	72 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
and i ' m able to open up one of these	63 63 63 63 56 56 63 63 63 63 63
is that as soon as they sign with an	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you film them and then you edit them	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the when the script was originally	63 63 63 63 63 63
the reason they asked this question is	63 72 63 63 63 56 32
enjoying this interview do me a solid	72 72 72 72 45 72 72
know like what your intentions are the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the entire casting process works	63 63 63 0 0
online by providing value if it	63 42 63 63 56 56

than just	36 36
i ' m not going to dive deep into this	56 56 56 64 63 63 63 63 63 63
so many people helping her but she was	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
going to be in the commercial so now	64 64 64 64 64 64 72 45
should be working on monologues because	63 72 72 72 64 64
that ' s really what I think made itself	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 81
properties let ' s say you have a property	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56

something that should have been taken in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
stress situation like a big budget	63 63 63 63 63 63
snatched up very fast and that ' s why you	64 63 63 56 56 32 32 32 32 56
it ' s important not to go to a talent	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
is imdb	64 64
to book you for a role in the movie it	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
through my lines the last thing I do	56 56 56 56 64 63 56 56
and the callback was once again	64 64 64 64 63 63
lot of people they ' ll read all the	56 56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63

i ' m really good at it and what am i	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 63 63
with long - term investing and even for	56 64 64 64 64 64 63 63
and understanding it but the as far as	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
number four is to get professional	0 0 0 0 0 0
eyeballs on me and therefore leading to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
be talking about today let ' s get started	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 0 0
directors producers a lot of them put a	64 63 64 64 64 40 40 64
working on right now so earlier this	63 63 63 63 63 56 56
I ' ve learned more about the body and how	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they ' ll make it right there	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

X or a T so when you go into an audition	40 40 40 40 32 56 56 56 56 56 36
for example one of my good friends when	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and say that there are many	40 40 40 40 40 40
potentially get a submission of	72 72 72 72 72
professionals they know what to do they	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
your first rental or investment property	56 56 64 56 56 56
you got an audition for a commercial and	63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
attention but that means it ' s also very	56 56 64 56 56 56 56 63 63
getting a lot of feedback from the other	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
spectrum and if your credit score is a	64 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
resume this is	0 0 0
casting platforms are actors access and	72 72 64 0 0 0

that a great audition doesn ' t guarantee	64 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

then you really will have to move to the	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
though this isn ' t part of your actual	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

with that won ' t reduce the quality of	49 56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
biking is it something where I ' m doing a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
funny story to tell	64 64 64 64
talk about today ' s topic which is how	72 63 63 63 63 63 36 36 63

that sixty thousand dollars is going to	35 56 56 56 49 28 28
can get involved there may be social	72 64 64 72 72 72 72
different things that you need to know	56 56 49 49 49 49 56
me from like this direction as I lie on	9 9 16 16 18 18 18 18 9
one of them the other ones have to be	64 64 24 36 36 36 63 63 63
smaller property that is only a single	64 56 56 72 72 72 72
then also keep an eye out for when they	63 63 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
minutes a day can be really beneficial	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you don ' t want to [UNK] just like peace	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actual question and the answer for	56 56 56 56 56 56
that you can take	72 72 72 72
to a major network so let ' s assume you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and television industry then you	56 56 56 56 35
they will actually reimburse you for	56 56 56 56 64 64
necessarily mean small city	72 72 72 72
day job like i was when i first started	63 63 63 72 72 63 72 64 64
shame yourself for not having the	0 0 0 0 0 0
by going to that link right up there	24 24 24 48 72 64 64 64
but if you haven ' t heard it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
years you will need it to the world	64 64 64 64 64 63 63 72
um the opportunity cost of potentially	56 56 56 72 36 36
sending those things out all the time so	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
photographer every single year or i	72 72 64 64 64 72
one audition for a movie per year on	63 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
of when they think real estate agent	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
interested in learning how i audition	63 63 63 63 72 72
number two another reason why every	63 63 63 63 63 63
if you ' re willing to do all of that for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
load of materials that teach you the ins	0 0 0 0 56 0 0 0
we ' ve all done if I book this role then	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
able to do that anyway but it does make	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that two to six hundred dollars might be	64 64 72 63 63 64 64 64
to you there are actually a number of	63 63 63 72 72 64 64 64
that promises that they can make you a	63 56 63 63 64 64 64 64
story because there are union	36 36 63 63 63
strength or	63 63
and that ' s only 12 seconds of work but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and best of all you don ' t need to be	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 64 64
director or on actors access or some	36 36 36 63 72 63 63
that you show up in the world	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
any questions alright until next time	64 64 63 63 63 63
sell to as a guy called Gary Vaynerchuk	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
like there are some things i can talk	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
all of those things cost money as well	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 63
that i found most useful when preparing	56 42 56 56 64 40 48
right there okay that ' s it for this	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72 72
first property it ' s not as simple as you	64 64 64 64 64 56 56 72 72 72
what these types of videos are similar	72 72 72 72 72 48 72
i say hey	72 72 72
that so for instance	72 72 72 72
you want to become a real estate	56 56 56 56 56 64 64
you need to break into the film and	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
a script but they told me this is a	56 32 45 72 36 32 56 56 56
size recessed lights you want so you can	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

different ways to find auditions without	64 64 64 64 56 63
and if you can get to	63 63 36 36 63 56

earlier on in the beginning of the video	72 64 64 64 64 64 64 24
specifically i ' ve put links to all three	64 36 36 36 63 63 63 63 63

can set up a lot of automations so	63 72 72 72 63 72 63 63
house and obviously when you ' re taking	56 63 63 63 56 56 56 56

there aren ' t any wrong choices there are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
directors know that if they post an	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

if your face is not seen on camera that	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
people and so especially i mean even if	72 72 72 63 63 72 72 72
kind of prepared for the scene	63 63 63 63 63 63
but i encourage you to watch this whole	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
your real estate license to help buy and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
believe in the circumstance but other	56 56 56 56 56 56

the other actors who don ' t fit the	32 56 56 56 56 56 56 63 64
your personality looks on camera it	63 63 45 45 45 56
after work hours or on your days off	56 56 64 64 63 63 63 72
and that will cost anywhere between	72 72 72 72 56 56
that ' s because agents and casting	72 72 72 56 56 64 64
so that ' s why it ' s really important to	24 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63 42
i do know actors that have spent over a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64
director said	45 45
actor records their audition at home and	63 63 63 63 63 36 36

let ' s say for a hundred pounds apiece	72 72 72 63 36 36 36 63 63
as i mentioned so many times before in	63 63 63 63 64 64 64 56
how do you get experience how do you add	64 64 72 63 63 63 72 64 72
but the reality is that it ' s going to be	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
my take on props and auditions agree	72 72 72 72 72 72 63
that i have impacted through my	64 63 63 63 63 63
with you either work with them in person	72 72 36 36 63 63 63 72
country do as much as you can in terms	64 64 64 56 56 56 56 56 56
this is the reality of the industry and	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
you have a few credits on there	63 63 63 63 63 36 63

they sent it to you on purpose	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

this started thirteen years ago when I	24 24 24 24 48 25 24
you see even small markets like my	56 63 63 63 56 56 56
back in 2015 I published a video titled	63 63 63 64 64 64 64 64

of your career i ' m approaching 15 years	63 63 63 63 63 63 72 64 64
earlier this year and i didn ' t book it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

and booked my role as well as the big	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
audition opportunities or	72 72 56
know that with having a great brand has	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you have also give this video a thumbs	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
how ' steep and story feeling low of	56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63
predict like what would have happened	63 63 63 63 63 63
the entire script that way let ' s say it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
already had experience acting in movies	36 36 36 36 63 63
first line my first line here is a few	64 72 72 63 63 63 72 72 72
code usually want to find some	72 56 32 56 56 56
pounds ago I was overweight on the BMI	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

with the 8 by 10 photo paper now	63 63 63 63 63 0 0 0
because different areas have	56 56 56 56
take a lot of write - offs that you	20 16 16 16 16 16 16 28 28
if you think that bookshelf is worth a	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
won ' t see success in the future so	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
especially when you consider the fact	56 63 63 63 63 63
for anybody else to do it	63 63 63 63 56 56
they would have all been recorded in the	9 9 36 36 63 36 36 36
same script the first line is a few	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
do is just understand how	72 63 63 63 63
a lot of business owners	63 63 63 63 63
make all of the digital products that we	32 32 32 20 63 72 72 72

getting your utilities cut off but it	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
outside of class let me say that again	64 64 64 64 64 63 63 25

second of all if you ' re interested in	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56 56
it would have had to be a much much	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
is to improvise a scenario where you	63 63 63 63 63 63 72
you ' re all the way at the bottom at a	56 56 56 56 64 56 56 56 56 56 49

making those connections now if you	64 64 64 64 63 63
that book if you feel like you need to	63 63 63 63 72 63 63 63 63
needs to be able to fit in this story	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
that is relocation costs when you move	64 64 63 56 56 56 56

three separate four hour study sessions	56 40 64 64 56 56
name is Kurt you thank you so much for	64 64 64 64 63 63 56 64 64
on hand picked the rules and the reasons	64 64 64 63 63 63 63 72
agency that submitted they might only be	36 36 36 36 36 36 36
helping out with a casting session one	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
people that you normally would not get	56 56 56 63 63 63 56
and film it yourself	63 63 63 56
from people	72 72
of that so	56 56 64
a reason why you should a couple of	63 63 63 63 63 56 63 63
involved in the commercial well	64 56 63 63 64
now sending all of the actors they	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
for it when we ' re first getting started	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
talking about sag	63 63 63
less than 20 % down rather than waiting	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
completely outside of his control so I	63 63 64 64 64 63 45
like unless you also own a business it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it would be probably going overboard to	25 25 25 25 25 25 25
a daily habit make it maybe once or	56 56 56 56 56 56 63 63
a lot of people want to know what are	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
essentially took one of our website	63 63 63 63 63 63
audition for those coveted roles and	9 9 36 36 36 36

we ' re talking for most people you can	56 56 56 63 56 56 56 56 56
out like a single tear so maybe I ' m like	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56 56 63
as well but i think those three are	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
those things okay so in this video we	72 64 64 64 40 64 64 64

bad right like that ' s only about twenty	64 64 64 64 64 64 63 64 56
and have everybody read for that role	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
down in the description below step	64 64 64 64 64 36
did and this actually is a lesson that i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
to be held more accountable you have to	32 20 20 32 56 56 56 56
a guy out for revenge like Steven Seagal	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the perfect job if you like helping	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
you ' re trying to pursue film and	64 64 64 64 64 64 72 72

stop me	56 56
would say on	63 63 63
now your chances are a lot slimmer also	63 63 63 63 56 56 56 63
and so people have asked me you know do	63 63 63 63 63 36 36 63 63
why a demo reel is so important for	63 63 72 72 72 63 72 64
california will probably rent out for	63 63 63 63 63 63
microphone closer to me and further away	64 64 32 32 32 32 56
about how to join because the ways to	56 64 64 64 64 56 56 56
or a politician who performs a speech	56 64 63 36 32 56 63
and put down less than twenty percent is	56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63
feeling called to do it	63 63 63 63 63
getting involved and getting your first	64 64 64 64 64 64
working with an agent	72 72 72 72
online it ' s the one I ' ve recommend to	63 63 63 63 4 4 4 4 4 4 0
and that ' s going to be important later	40 45 45 45 45 45 64 32 32
improvement for that neighborhood and	56 56 56 56 56
travel costs they have to pay for a	63 42 56 56 56 56 56 64
so for example let ' s say you start	64 64 56 63 63 63 63 63 72
chance of booking the part but when it	63 63 63 36 63 63 63 63
your website down in the comments or in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also need to consider that it ' s probably	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you put this on the MLS the next morning	56 56 63 56 56 63 63 63 63
at least in 2020	56 56 56 56
dollars of that hundred dollars and you	81 64 72 81 72 56 56
here ' s another thing that you should	64 64 64 64 56 56 56 63
actually read the information and you	56 56 56 56 56 56
companies out there so whenever you	63 63 56 56 63 56
you know just from past experience it	0 0 0 0 0 56 56
anywhere now let ' s move on to the next	56 64 64 64 64 64 72 72 72 63
people whatever it is you could try	24 24 24 24 24 24 24
light options those are way too blue	56 56 63 63 63 64 63
in that role and i think that ' s really	45 64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63
worry about that don ' t worry about	72 72 72 63 63 63 36 36
original question of was was sitting	40 35 24 24 24 63
good because you know we make money	64 64 56 63 63 63 63
why i	63 63
acting for a company a company is using	63 63 63 63 64 64 72 64

this type of information is included in	56 56 56 64 64 64 64
spending some time here with me today	64 64 64 64 56 56 64
a great place to start is to search for	56 56 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
and a professional resume	63 63 63 63
in hollywood there are some well	56 56 56 56 56 72
apps can help you stay on top of your	32 49 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
when you first begin expect your income	24 63 56 56 63 56 56
i really want to play in the nba i	56 56 56 56 56 64 56 56 56
acting gigs available the vast	72 72 72 63 63
really visually appealing on the MLS so	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
have to have this and it got to a point	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

through the lines without doing any	63 63 63 63 63 63

over in this video first is don ' t read	56 56 56 25 25 25 20 20 20 64

what ' s up my fellow actors welcome to	0 0 0 0 0 24 25 64 64
you need to be prepared for the	56 63 63 63 63 63 63

over the country this is why I said	63 64 64 63 63 63 63 63
career and that ' s why I ' m calling them	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
have a photo printer but never even knew	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
kind of audience as Gary Vaynerchuk and	32 32 32 56 56 42 63
don ' t take your voice in your subject of	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
and invitations to maybe 50 or 100	63 72 72 72 63 63 63
how many things have i bought that were	63 56 64 64 64 42 56 56
technique that I ' m going to share with	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
or you can go grocery shopping and make	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
century fox	63 63
advantage and if you ' re young and you	0 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63

they ' re going to need to make movies	72 72 72 72 72 72 64 56 64
but in smaller markets like atlanta	56 56 64 64 64 64
or a condo you ' ll probably have to share	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
bedroom place numbers would have been	63 63 63 63 63 63
means you don ' t need to pay it up front	56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64 64 64 64
number of things that the real estate	56 56 56 56 56 56 56

of production the prop plays a very	56 56 56 56 63 63 63
flow and you can also have massive tax	56 56 56 56 32 20 56 56
again kind of	63 36 24
time house hacker the best deals are	63 63 63 56 56 63 63

straight to the government as	35 28 49 56 56
and that ' s something that profit first	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
is that we could make a pretty	24 24 24 24 24 24 24
there is something big	20 20 20 63
a critical mistake that an actor makes	63 63 63 63 63 63 72

they got this from your statement to the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

example in palo alto where i was raised	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
there ' s a lot more to it than just	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

only bring back the people that they are	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

business card and you	36 72 63 63
really valuable resources and I can send	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
necessarily your most	64 56 56
director or a client might ask you tell	64 63 63 63 64 64 64 64
there might be a cut off for union	32 32 32 32 32 36 72 64
you learn the skills you need to break	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64

been running for nine and a half years	64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
viewers attention from my face you want	56 56 24 24 24 24 64
only goes through agencies and are not	72 72 72 72 64 72 63
to consider is not spending enough money	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
pass that as well so the first step is	0 0 0 0 0 63 63 63 63
resources as possible not just me i mean	63 63 63 72 72 64 64 63
both of those are union states where	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
film and TV auditions and one for	72 63 63 63 63 63 63
if everybody ' s saying the same thing how	63 63 63 63 72 63 63 63 63

that was able to bring in an equity	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they got to a point where you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

find a good tenant that will make your	0 56 42 24 24 15 30 0
is how this works for me is that when	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

learning and acting class where you can	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

and then right hook but obviously you	64 42 63 63 63 42 24
maybe uh an extra day but	63 56 56 56 56 64
plus I think it looks more professional	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
is just that the teaching style is a bit	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
hundreds or even thousands of actor	63 63 63 63 63 72
you can either find a tenant yourself	56 32 20 56 56 56 56

thing you need to know is that you need	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
recommend looking at as many testing	63 35 56 56 56 56
whether you get cut or not	63 63 63 63 63 63
that ' s really going to help you to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

know this but	20 20 20
initiation fee and that initiation fee	64 64 64 64 64 64
that ' s insane	63 63 63 63
book television shows like The Vampire	63 64 64 72 64 64
question because the truth is an agent	64 64 64 64 64 64 40
thing they want is for you to not be	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64
miss any payments or have anything go	56 56 56 64 64 56 56
they ' re kind of considered on a level	24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24
credit score so let ' s say that you have	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
guys to try and do is attach a monthly	63 63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
you can really see success so yeah	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
guys like the video make sure to hit	64 64 64 64 63 63 63 63
and in California that ' s going to be	63 56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
probably not but it might have helped it	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
smart passive income and they ' ve got a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 64
agent costs and the misconception that	63 63 63 63 56 56
get a good night ' s sleep eat some good	56 56 56 63 63 63 56 64 64 64
that you ' re that you ' re seeking yeah so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
agents you will 100 need to do it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
from it as well just because I ' ve seen	36 63 72 72 72 63 63 63 63 63
if you ' re doing a ton and a ton of deals	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64
and also to become a successful real	56 64 56 56 56 56 56
video right here where I talk about the	35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35
and yeah i want you guys to know that	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
really wanted to get you on this show so	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it ' s a TV set and we ' re a recurring	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
probably going to cost more money than	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
and and it ' s a fair question that a lot	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it so	64 64
very important to print our headshots on	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
sometimes two three four five hundred	72 63 72 72 72 72
with me at weddings i had a photo editor	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
out to tenants	56 56 56
get 29 . 5 000	16 16 16 16 28
so many acting classes are available via	63 56 56 56 63 72 72
it ' s just a lot easier to take that	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
about the audition process	45 72 72 72
why i want you to get advice from as	64 64 72 64 72 63 63 63 72
shower pulling a shower really pretty	0 0 0 0 0 0
in person yeah all right all right	0 0 0 0 0 0 64
that you ' ve designed to get an idea of	64 64 64 64 64 56 56 64 63 63
how it works is you can basically deduct	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
gave an example so in this video I want	64 64 64 64 64 64 56 63 63
witnessed it working for someone else	64 64 64 56 56 56
be performing that scene twice blocking	56 64 64 64 64 56
it really changed my mindset when it	63 63 36 36 36 63 56
season one and season two of the show	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
and the projects that are filming in	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

websites that are used so you ' ll have to	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
anything and what this does is it helps	56 56 56 56 56 42 63 63
something they ' re not gonna push you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you ' re doing an online course for	56 56 56 56 63 63 63 64 64
size and she held up the pages of the	36 63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
she says to dress in whatever way that	64 64 72 63 63 63 63 63
job needs to be something that we	64 64 72 72 72 72 72
consideration well like i mentioned	64 72 72 72 72
know you ' re gonna have some questions so	63 36 36 36 9 36 36 36 72
down on yourself understand that simply	63 63 63 63 63 56
strengthening and mobilizing the whole	0 0 0 0 0
said anything about shaq all i knew was	32 56 63 63 63 64 64 63

in front of the casting director well a	64 64 64 64 63 63 63 64
as actors now we finally have the	63 63 32 32 56 56 56
i consider that investing in real estate	56 56 56 64 64 64 64
and i had no idea until i showed up on	63 63 36 36 45 64 64 64 63 24
separate home office room it also needs	0 0 0 56 20 20 20
that ' s helped me book over 50 movies and	63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64 64
i didn ' t end up booking that role but i	63 36 36 36 63 63 63 63 36 36 36
thousand dollars in credit debt and if	64 56 63 56 56 63 56

my resume directly on the back the	56 56 63 63 63 63 63
attention away from my audition so make	64 63 63 63 63 63 63
acting goals are	64 64 64
fulfillment becomes more deeply embedded	0 25 25 25 0
career and be remembered I ' m really glad	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
part of an audition is what ' s going on	45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45
these are small plays that are done	56 56 56 72 72 72 64
as well as a ballpark figure for how	72 72 72 72 72 63 63 63
read and you follow those taping	56 56 56 56 56 56
flowdesk and flowdesk is the email list	56 64 72 72 72 64 63
state ' s real estate department they	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
you so much for watching and if you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
just because you don ' t have that 20	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
first starting out	72 72 64
how i auditioned for those	64 64 64 64 64
accessible if you want to join me in	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
becoming a landlord house hacking is not	63 56 63 63 56 56 56
that you ' re putting towards your career	72 72 72 72 64 64 64 72
that ' s not working I ' ll try another if I	63 63 63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 64 63
williams and exp i know that they have	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
prevent living paycheck to paycheck	63 63 63 63 63
very cheap they range from maybe like 50	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72
can be	64 64
takeaways that i think	24 24 36 63
without an agent can go onto those	63 63 63 63 63 64 64
first casting director is Sharon B Ali	72 72 63 63 63 63 63
important just know that there ' s a huge	56 56 56 64 56 56 56 56 56
so similarly if you want your job to be	63 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
this industry is by being a stunt	64 56 36 36 63 64 56
of actors will say well if i need a demo	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 32 56 56
please hire me i ' m a graphic designer	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
your location of your property	63 63 63 63 63
color lime green or red or a really	64 64 72 56 56 56 63 63
thumbnail that i used for this video is	63 63 63 64 64 64 64 64
it ' s important to go to a professional	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
which i talked about in my video last	63 63 72 64 63 63 63 56
why is that one is because they run out	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
guys to be able to take the same skills	56 56 56 56 49 49 56 56 56
more of you let ' s use that explosion	72 36 36 64 64 64 56 56 56
website then once you ' ve done that you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
callback then i got put on first refusal	56 36 36 36 36 56 56 63
that was step 11 . step 12	56 56 63 63 63 56 56
self - employment tax aka fica this is	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
so you ' ll save lots of time and money on	63 56 56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
situation throughout my entire audition	64 64 64 64 63
are casting a project not just one part	24 24 24 63 45 72 72 72
well as the big lesson that i learned	32 56 56 64 64 64 64 64
of those projects were	63 64 64 64
you know there ' s just there ' s so many	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
movies and tv shows now and i ' ve gotten	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
off of that project	72 72 72 72
that as much as 80 percent of new agents	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
is to create your own content	64 56 64 64 64 63
student film or a web series and you	72 72 72 72 72 72 64 64
you are most interested in is it movies	64 32 32 64 64 64 63 72
area it ' s pretty cool and then they also	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 63 63 63
a result that type of mindset makes it	63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
and even if you do have some experience	64 56 56 64 56 56 72 64
classes sometimes and the last thing	64 64 56 56 56 56
those student films again	56 64 63 63
actor because	64 64
lawyer or a publicist	64 64 64 64
question like so many other questions in	63 56 56 63 63 63 63
to help them cast the movie the casting	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
save a little bit of money	63 63 63 63 63 0
out on disney plus and i play a school	64 64 64 0 0 0 0 0 0
starting out in their career they ' re so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and the reason I brought up the long	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
already know you ' re an actor they have	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 63
what should you wear when you ' re walking	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
checks as well so it can be a great	56 56 56 63 72 72 72 72 64
audition script if you covered up the	64 56 56 56 56 56 56
for their self taping now if you want to	64 64 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
exam and when you pass that final exam	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56

okay let ' s learn how to create an acting	63 63 63 63 63 45 64 64 64 64
for co - star guest star recurring or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ohio i got	72 63 63
career to pursue and it takes	63 63 63 63 63 63
to shoot in 1080p and your file sizes	56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
think a solid color wall is the best	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
happening in this scene you also get an	35 56 63 63 63 63 63 63
so i feel like that ' s something really	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
then let me tell you this i think there	63 63 63 63 63 72 72 72 72
ones that make the best investment back	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it ' s just roll into your loan and you	56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64 56
then you have to go to a professional	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72
me wrong	56 56
or la then you could probably get by	64 64 64 64 64 64 63 63
that you continuously see	64 56 56 63
rid of your PMI payments once you reach	63 63 56 56 63 63 63 63
for under 20 % down if you think that you	63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64 56 64
one role	63 63
self - doubts if you ' re having	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
non - union projects	72 72 72 72
on one of your parents cards now you	56 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
they can ' t trust you to turn your	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
to self - tape auditions at home	72 72 72 72 72 63 24
thanks to minimalism honestly we need a	56 56 56 56 63 63 63
good - looking enough for some parts but	56 56 56 56 56 64 64 72
had no idea	63 63 63
able to make your payments and for them	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56
account who can share with you so	72 72 64 64 64 64 64
will take this seriously and that you	63 72 72 63 63 63 63
that i use	64 64 56
and with a triplex you have two rentable	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
hotel while they ' re here	64 72 63 63 63 63
the casting breakdown or the character	63 63 63 63 63 63
week and post them to my channel alright	56 63 56 64 64 64 56 36
the agent will then tell the actor hey	56 56 32 64 72 64 45 72
i ' m not 100 sure i would have had the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
call our job	42 42 63
term sides copy refers to the lines that	56 56 56 72 63 64 64 64
happens to fit well then you ' ve got a	0 0 0 56 56 72 72 72 72 72

right in theater is the only time where	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
let me jump in for a second if you	72 72 45 72 72 72 72 72 72
even helping a casting director in a	56 56 56 35 64 72 72
all of those tapes at this point there	72 72 72 63 64 64 56 56
probability of passing on your first try	64 56 56 56 56 56 64
director in the industry I ' ve actually	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you kind of plan for that is it is it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

agents out there that you ' ve never heard	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
so we had to go out and pay for someone	40 64 64 64 0 0 0 0 0 0
putting it into the house and when you	56 56 16 16 49 56 56 20
get a couple clients in the beginning	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that is so it ' s important that we rename	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72 72
extended warranties are just not worth	56 56 56 56 56 56
and this question is good because it	0 63 63 63 63 63 63

but i do have some free resources	72 72 72 72 72 72 64

because you ' re a good actor doesn ' t mean	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
already booking well the truth is	72 72 64 64 64 63
space feel a lot more open a lot bigger	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
not in the sense because you don ' t have	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

absolutely make a ton of money for	63 56 56 56 63 63 56
then connect the two of you	63 63 63 63 63 63
they think that my dogs a pretty big dog	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the productions were going on	56 56 64 64 56
and they wanted me to audition again the	56 32 32 32 32 64 64 36
products are the easiest way to save	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
that you can find on your own	72 72 72 72 63 36 63
people who just like to create and have	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
you ' re in a high cost of living area	32 32 32 32 56 56 56 56 56 56
either a project or a performer so a	56 56 56 64 64 72 72 72
but understand that theater acting	64 40 40 64 63
in this case for an actor you may need a	64 64 64 72 63 63 63 63 42 64
want someone to always be on the lookout	56 56 56 56 56 64 64 56
basically consists of a bunch of slides	56 56 32 32 32 56 56
so they have two things isn ' t her sake	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the last lesson I learned that day came	72 64 64 40 40 25 25 25
so here ' s how the audition process went	63 72 72 72 64 64 64 64 56
there are many business expenses that	56 56 56 56 63 56
jobs and the history of work and how we	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
those on your casting websites in	64 56 36 9 9 36
showcase for	63 64
know when a relationship is gonna pay	63 56 56 64 64 64 64
it ' s a big decision so do your research	63 63 63 36 36 72 72 72 72 63
to talk about was specifically for	0 0 0 0 0 0
investment or rental property if you	56 56 49 49 56 56
questions or if there are any audition	63 63 63 64 64 64 64
because that also makes you look	0 0 0 0 0 0
mobility you know if you ' re in the honey	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
more scratch resistant and waterproof	63 63 63 63 63
passive income i ' ve joined at this point	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it I hear myself during these workouts	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
auditioning is a completely separate	56 56 56 56 56
channel because	64 64
the one i recommend you guys try out is	56 63 63 63 64 64 64 64 0
graph because if it took you 30 years to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you take something like an	63 63 63 63 63
out and throw a 100 bill away right and	56 56 56 49 63 63 63 63 56
to house hack your way to a zero dollar	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the actual exercising part of it and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then i just don ' t know how useful	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 72 64
this state	63 64
to get started acting in your city right	72 72 64 64 63 63 63 63
instead of thinking of money as this	42 42 42 42 42 42 42
to wait five days before you purchase	56 64 56 56 56 32 56
can you react to the explosion but cheat	32 32 36 36 36 36 36 36
throughout my entire career	56 56 56 64
also could potentially	72 64 64
many different cities like i mentioned	63 63 63 63 63 63
i ' m willing to pay for my own hotel when	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it ' s because they have decades of	63 63 63 36 36 63 63 63
principal performer	56 64
as a film and television actor you see a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you ' re struggling with	63 63 63 63 56
you ' re doing something that works for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
money and automatically invest it when	56 56 32 56 56 64
zero cost of distribution and hopefully	72 72 45 72 36 36
they ' re way ahead of themselves they	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
too you can find	64 64 64 63
you want to learn the best and you can	56 56 56 56 56 63 63 56 56
all connected you know it ' s life is it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for it and boom you get offered a role	63 72 63 63 63 63 63 64 64
jobs are 4050 hours per week right that	56 56 63 63 63 56 56 56
we did some of the script but then we	42 56 56 63 63 63 56 32 32
so they decided okay we can ' t consider	63 63 72 36 32 32 32 32 32
fit the role and this happens all the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
about these types of warranties	64 64 64 56 56
in some sort of sports or	0 0 0 0 0 0
and remember that relationships are a	72 63 63 63 64 64
whole your finances and what you need to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
are in california and you are looking	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
but you don ' t get the future payments in	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
that i would give and i do think that	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
working like a nine - to - five job and it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the audition can be live and in person	56 56 56 56 64 56 56 56

until 9 : 00 p . m . or something so for a	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
you ' re paying in taxes and you already	20 20 20 16 20 20 20 20 20

it to real life scenarios so it ' s much	0 0 0 0 0 63 63 63 63 56
being cast in that type of role so when	56 56 56 64 64 64 64 64 63
my number one tip is to sign up for some	56 40 56 56 64 56 56 56 56 56
refers to your professional headshot	72 72 63 63 63
credits that will go on imdb with your	64 56 56 56 64 56 56 56

just so you can get something from them	36 32 32 32 63 63 63 63
unless you are a big time celebrity you	32 32 32 8 32 32 64 64

that anyone can promise you if they do	72 72 63 63 63 56 32 56
experience in this video how do we start	64 64 64 64 64 32 36 63

practicing the intent and the	32 32 32 32 56

month for PMI that ' s actually not too	0 0 0 0 0 0 63 63 63
questions that they want us to improvise	63 56 63 56 63 36 63
really hard to make that move to the us	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
possible to become a working actor in my	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and if meal planning is what works for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and commercials	63 63
it ' s just a very complicated process	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
maybe they needed someone older or maybe	64 45 72 64 64 72 63
know they have solid experience teaching	63 72 63 63 63 63
you learn the skills you need to break	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
your business is going to grow	63 63 63 63 63 63
whenever you have some free time a	63 63 63 63 63 56 63
on acting in theater and	64 64 64 64 72
i never have to join the union	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the small markets but in the major	64 64 63 63 63 63 63
you can check out other resources that	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
so i encourage you guys to refer back to	64 64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
and then my hair color	0 0 0 0 0
career okay i hope that was helpful if	63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
let ' s say for example that they want to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
in full costume for an audition hey like	63 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
in movies and tv shows too when i worked	64 64 64 64 64 40 40 40 40
footage meaning a demo reel to show us	56 56 56 56 56 64 40 40
actors union we ' ll go over questions	36 36 64 64 64 64 64 72
learning about how	72 63 63
high school gym class all right so that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
look comfortable natural and real on	63 63 63 63 63 63
could in your business	63 63 63 63
see every way that they ask things	20 56 56 56 56 56 56
talent agents aren ' t going to sign	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
now finally the actor comes into play	72 72 72 72 72 72 63
why because sometimes there will be	72 72 63 63 63 63
so much and I ended up turning down the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
gonna suck anyway probably don ' t even	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
needed so what I would do is go on	56 32 56 56 56 32 32 32 56
Tim Ferriss say is to just produce a ton	63 56 63 63 42 42 42 42 42
workouts you know that ' s not something	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is the prep stage of real estate	63 63 63 63 63 56 64 64
came to	56 63
because that process helped teach me	64 64 64 56 56 63
can you purchase for me what can you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
invested in stocks	56 56 56
biggest difference here is that union	56 56 56 63 64 64
are a lot of actors out there that are	63 63 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
and experience under my belt I make over	0 0 25 30 48 0 0 0
and always have a rental agreement in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
was the main character i ' m not 100 sure	56 56 56 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
a little bit more freely	63 63 63 63 63
so take that background work off your	63 63 56 64 63 63 63
because it suddenly becomes scalable	24 24 24 24 64
is by taking acting classes and that can	56 56 56 63 64 72 72 63
are some factors that are out of our	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
that more expensive mortgage or rental	56 63 63 63 63 63
something like that let ' s say your	56 63 63 56 56 56 56 56
build wealth and set yourself up for the	56 32 32 56 56 56 56 56
something that i ' m really going to be	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
you sign with is a reputable law ok guys	56 63 63 56 56 56 56 63 63
cut from the movie and you only got to	56 56 56 63 56 56 40 40 32
my other issue with	64 64 64 64
and it ' s just so much easier in my	63 63 63 63 56 56 56 63 63 63
you can copy and paste	0 0 0 0 0
outsourced as much as you possibly can	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
started shooting the rest of the show	36 63 63 63 63 63 63
starting out we have no idea if	56 56 56 56 63 63 63
just the	64 64
comes in and asks us to add this line	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
pay mortgage insurance mortgage	63 63 63 63
I ' m also utilizing what I have and not	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i went full time	63 63 63 63
and then just cancel out the other	56 56 56 63 63 63 63
have you been doing everything that you	42 63 63 63 63 63 63
like in all the different aspects of	56 63 63 63 56 56 56
usually if that includes the name of the	72 72 72 72 64 64 64 64
home purchase without anything down so	56 56 56 56 63 63
real estate course this should take	56 56 56 56 63 63
a good actor	64 64 56
locked in a pitch - black closet don	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 72
to carry on this conversation that is	35 56 56 56 56 64 63
want people	36 36
commercial at all	64 64 64
able like this you know paleo is very	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
casting director that will also send	64 64 56 64 64 64
real estate investing whether that	64 64 56 63 63
afterwards and now we are finally ready	0 63 63 63 63 63 63
unless it ' s an emergency right so you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
leaves you with a lot of time to work on	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
and you get headshots that look	63 63 63 63 63 63
role without ever auditioning for it	64 40 64 64 56 32
kind of three broad categories of things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
look at it and you ' re thinking you got	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
be able to pick it up for at least	64 0 72 72 72 64 0 0 64
brings a smile to my face and I I just	45 72 72 72 72 72 72 63 63 63
in the united states movies and tv shows	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
section of a resume	0 0 0 0
so your total loan now becomes one	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in one year if it ' s over 6 000 pounds	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
these in my career when i first started	72 72 72 72 64 64 64 64
you can really see why it ' s so critical	56 63 63 56 56 64 64 64 56 56
i ' m really happy that i had to drive	64 64 64 64 64 72 72 72 48 48
be the type of person to offer to help	64 64 64 64 64 32 36 36 36
going to help you out much in the field	56 56 56 56 63 63 56 56 20
that you have what it takes to become an	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
floors just let my gym be free and then	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
channel so in that old video I explained	64 64 64 72 72 72 72 64
know so just find those good deals and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
if you don ' t book one particular job if	36 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
if you love your full - time job don	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
auditions for every single role so	63 72 72 63 63 63
that how is that actually an investment	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
to two things it can refer to either a	72 56 56 56 64 64 72 48 72
to create and	64 64 64
and then production had to scramble and	72 56 56 56 56 72 72
important i think that ' s something that	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they have to pay their per diem while	64 64 64 56 56 56 56 64
that ' s a lot more like routine mobility	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
some of the greates	63 63 63 63
know any local actor that they have	72 64 72 56 64 64 64
making a lot of money doing these	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
you learn the skills you need to break	63 63 63 63 56 56 56 56
they ' re going to be asking you to do all	63 63 63 63 63 72 63 63 63 63 63
speaking of resources you can download	64 64 24 24 24 24
possible you know we want to have our	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
need specifically	63 0
actor and	36 63
anything that is related to your	63 56 56 56 56 56
to renovate it	0 0 0
some taping services that will	63 63 63 63 63
so just know exactly how much you will	32 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
work on any	45 72 64
the money it ' s always helpful to adopt	0 63 63 63 63 56 56 63 63
succeed has nothing to do with their	64 64 63 63 63 56 63
how to answer it now I can ' t tell you	64 63 63 64 64 63 63 63 63 64 64
so that ' s a great way to get started a	72 72 72 72 72 64 64 64 64 64 64
expect to pay probably not much more	64 64 64 63 63 63 63
it ' s your brand visuals all of those	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
with and I ' ll record for instance line	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64
to get acting experience	64 64 64 64
says in the commercial the next term is	72 72 72 72 64 56 56 56
take a commission	72 72 72
agents actually don ' t charge you any	64 72 72 72 72 72 63 32
around the country around the world	64 64 64 64 64 63
almost all of them	63 63 63 63
because having those consistent bookings	63 63 63 63 63
test is gonna be a hundred fifty	63 63 63 63 63 0 0
twenty seven hundred dollars per month	0 0 0 0 0 0
kind of newer in the industry or just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

put down under 20 % the first one is the	63 63 63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56
it all down it just helps me internalize	63 63 63 63 56 64 64 64
your email list usually about three	63 63 63 63 63 63
aren ' t going to need that whole time the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
at all so after the zoom callback	64 64 48 48 40 64 64
important when trying to come up with a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you ' re going to be asked to perform a	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64

the role	56 56
right for me my faith is really	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
pre - approval now i think about this	56 56 56 63 72 64 64 64
years ago I was in London for work what	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72 81

most actors start out living in some	63 63 72 72 64 56 64
set and networking opportunities and all	56 56 63 63 56 56
making well over one million dollars	63 63 63 63 63 63
is self - taping equipment the world of	63 63 63 63 64 64 64 64
one it ' s a lot of fun two we ' re always	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and i didn ' t book any of those initial	72 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
know basis if you don ' t need to know	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 36
Tim Ferriss who kind of modeled this	63 64 64 64 64 64 63
you know there ' s a variety in there you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
up paying more	64 64 64

investor by buying and selling yourself	0 63 63 63 63 63
for it look even better have a great and	64 64 63 63 63 63 64 64 64
industry standard is to print our	63 72 48 72 63 63
a feeling like that and I don ' t think	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
will send out one audition of one role	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

now so you can do all of that from your	63 63 63 63 64 64 64 64 64 64
and they would use that audition to cast	63 63 63 63 63 56 63 63
out the hours per day for however long	63 56 63 63 63 63 63 63
the point where they don ' t even look	63 63 63 72 72 72 72 63 63
don ' t think it is	40 40 40 56 63 63
career there ' s going to come a time	63 36 36 36 63 63 63 63 63
help with taxes but that ' s not the truth	56 56 56 32 20 20 20 32 56 56
weight sure and that ' s when you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
confident that I could make this place	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

please comment below and I ' ll answer	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they could potentially add footage to	63 63 63 72 72 72
people you know one they only need 30	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a year and so ultimately as robin says	0 0 63 63 63 25 25 0
other business they ' re trying	63 64 64 64 64 64
many contacts experience good	63 63 63 63
audition let me give you a couple of	64 56 56 56 56 64 64 64
everything that ' s happening in our face	24 42 42 42 24 24 24 24
and i will try to answer as many of your	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and that we ' re not making any mistakes	72 72 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
particular role because	56 56 63
if you want to pursue	64 64 40 40 40
actors access or backstage or casting	56 56 56 64 56 64
gotta know your lines so you can please	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I remember a few years ago	63 63 63 63 63 63
either union	56 56
backyard or any other common areas the	0 0 0 0 0 0 56
running Facebook or Instagram ads you	24 42 42 42 72 72
incredible opportunities that i would	63 63 64 64 64
some training and then you will have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they decided to open up the role to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
single job	63 63
pretty outside so we want to make sure	63 63 0 0 0 0 0 0
parts you might be too short for other	56 56 63 63 63 63 64 64
hopefully that makes sense and this	63 63 63 63 63 63
so if dozens of agents all send all of	24 24 24 24 24 24 24 63 63
yes i really want to be an actor and i	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
a lot of people are going to want to	64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
was in a position where i was still	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
goes live because it ' s just insane um	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
fit the description is	63 63 63 63
take them about one month to process the	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
because agents need a professional	72 72 63 56 56
the room now if you have never heard the	0 0 72 63 63 56 63 63 72
potentially help you in the future oh	64 64 64 36 25 25 64
really enjoy it so I think it ' s very	63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56 56 63
ever handling the watch at all now I	36 25 40 64 64 56 64 56
we ' re in the middle of the pandemic so	42 42 42 42 42 63 63 63 64 64
interest payments to your overall loan	63 63 63 63 63 63
you haven ' t already subscribe to this	56 72 72 72 72 64 64 64
guess what it ' s also possible to be too	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
i mean that ' s the power of a network	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 25
remember to subscribe to this channel to	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
tension you know there ' s a lot of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
specifically i ' m going to	64 56 56 56 56 56
people in Alaska and people in Ethiopia	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
can ' t bring to the table	63 63 63 63 64 64 63
school and you ' re currently working a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
into your account	64 64 64
I book this role then oh I ' ve got I	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and tell them i ' m interested in being an	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56
first step is learning how to act	72 72 72 72 56 56 56
maybe between 5 and 10 hours of your	63 56 56 63 63 63 56 56
first year	0 0
have had different experiences than i	72 72 56 56 56 56
is bigger pockets they have a website	64 0 0 0 0 0 0
a first	63 63
audition for crying out loud so show	64 64 64 64 64 64 63
and then i ' m going to open up a blank	63 63 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 63 63
of negotiating contracts and whether or	72 72 72 72 72 72
and that is to maybe go to a photography	56 56 56 56 56 56 24 24 24
of getting a piece of that multi	64 56 56 56 56 56 56
this time with the director in the room	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64
your auditions in on time all right	64 64 64 64 63 24 64
costs in the first couple years as an	64 64 64 64 64 63 63 64
applies to you it ' ll have a really big	63 64 56 63 63 63 63 56 64 64
spending your money	64 64 64
if you let those doubts and insecurities	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
very very rarely will i have more than	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
down in that time period and even if	64 63 64 56 56 56 56 56
more intense work but primarily with	0 0 0 0 0 0
say that if you really want to be super	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
change this line and then change this	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
advantage of those classes that are	63 63 64 64 64 56
with these are the things that you shoot	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they gave i think four or five	56 56 56 32 32 32 56
not you should join	63 63 63 63
role was for a police officer I	63 63 63 72 63 63 63
makes sense on why a demo reel is so	63 63 56 56 56 32 32 40 64
you are pursuing	36 36 32
story so props are not the main focus of	63 63 56 63 63 63 63 63 63
for most of you guys i think the solo	56 63 63 63 63 36 36 63 56
it ' s been a great part - time side hustle	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
just like a basketball player has to	64 72 72 72 72 72 48
starting today and you can catch my	32 56 56 64 64 64 64
place outside at night or it ' s a you	64 64 64 64 64 63 63 63 72 64
that would be ridiculous wouldn ' t it so	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
from memorization because you gotta know	0 0 0 0 0 0
going to be needing audition experience	63 63 63 63 63 63
agent so you would put your own phone	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actors who are not at that level	63 56 56 56 56 64 64
head shot because in this step of the	64 64 24 63 63 63 63 63
if this is your first time here hit that	64 64 64 64 64 64 72 48 48
payment is to offset the risk that these	56 56 56 63 63 63 64 56
same room together and part of the	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
so there are people that have won film	63 63 63 63 56 56 56 56
you have so much freedom in your	63 72 72 72 72 63 63
phase one setting will let you	35 56 56 35 35 56
for actors who want to grow their	63 63 72 72 72 72 72
invested in the bay area early or even	63 63 0 0 0 0 0 0
I ' ve lived in Atlanta for a few years	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
faster well the truth is	56 56 56 56 56
you ' re basically telling the world that	63 63 63 63 24 63 63 63
if your resume looks like this and it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
even if it ' s indirectly they may not	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 72
refer to your two marks as your one and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
are three traits that i don ' t think i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
training to this audition	72 72 72 72
shipping I also don ' t like the fact that	0 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 63
professionals will go to to check out	63 63 63 63 63 72 72
than a week	64 64 64
take a look see what you can cut out and	63 56 56 56 63 63 56 63 63 56
all those things let ' s say you ' re even	56 64 64 56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
do you need an agent to become an actor	72 72 72 72 72 56 56 56 63
the difference in delaying your	56 56 56 64 64
our acting so make sure you are well lit	63 24 24 24 24 63 63 24 24
actually take so	56 64 72
because of the way that i was created	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
in the way i can connect with you guys	63 63 63 63 63 63 35 35 35
to be the principal place of business	20 20 16 16 20 20 28
the library and just finding these books	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
don ' t set the bar super high I mean my	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
need to go to someone who specializes in	63 63 63 56 56 63 56 56
only give those auditions to talent	72 72 72 72 72 72
any benefits or any of those things	72 72 64 64 64 64 64
big three there are some other cities	63 72 72 72 63 63 56
york or atlanta then	63 63 63 63
basically so let ' s let ' s talk about what	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you hand them your resume and you did a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a $ 30 per month virtual class we do six	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it and i knew that this was all part of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
basically some type of service that	56 56 56 64 64 64
those deals and like i mentioned earlier	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
results that you ' re seeing in other	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and check out if they do something in	40 72 72 64 64 63 63 72
vacation whenever you want you can	25 25 25 25 25 25
are made in the same factories as the	56 56 56 56 63 56 63 72
is asked is to strike up a conversation	64 64 64 64 64 64 72 64
and carry they ' re the six things that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
shape what I would do is just change out	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64
classes if your	72 63 63
account with head of so you need only a	63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
point which is	56 42 63
camera to see somebody with some life in	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
always looking for	56 56 56
have that	64 64
well i ' m not talking about big hollywood	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
for a lot of newer actors so um i had a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
all of these things are sacrifices that	63 64 64 64 64 64 64
that ' s gonna get you the best rate and	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
has made that happen and if you know	64 64 64 72 63 63 63 63
fulfillment and satisfaction and value	25 25 25 25 25
angle your face in your body so that the	20 20 25 25 25 25 64 64 72
essentially sharing that credit card	56 64 64 64 56
got an audience of people that you can	24 24 24 24 42 42 24 0
like kind of a boxing analogy I think a	72 45 72 72 72 64 54 40 63
advice that you ' re gonna hear from	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
enough sleep and I like the idea of what	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
same mistake I did	72 63 63 63
you might as well buy more units if you	56 64 56 56 64 56 56 64 56
own personal website and if you want to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
doing is that you ' re slowly	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
your own license for doing your own	35 63 63 42 56 56 56
acting career center	72 72 72

that we ' re buying firstly did i receive	56 56 56 56 25 25 25 25 25
this answering when answering tour took	0 0 0 0 0 0
expensive what we chose to do is replace	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

they ' re gonna do all the work for me now	36 36 36 36 36 63 56 63 63 63 63

the pursuit of an	63 72 72 72
no agent no headshot no resume you	63 63 63 63 63 64 64
can sustain I think what you just said	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is really one of the best ways for	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
prove to an agent that you are taking	72 72 72 72 64 64 72 72

you learn the skills you need to break	64 40 40 72 64 64 64 64
so that ' s why i think monologues are a	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
really bad ones which leads us to the	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64

are the ones where i know the educators	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
then that really is a terrible way to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

your social media channels another thing	63 63 63 63 63 63
and making your profit a priority um	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

something with their phone	64 64 64 64
at least a thousand of these questions	56 56 56 56 63 63 56

this office space i was this close to	56 56 32 32 32 63 64 72
theater is that a lot of people have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
technique classes improv scene study	64 64 63 63 63

yourself okay be myself yeah you ' re on a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

move around because you could easily	63 63 64 56 56 56
for yourself and look you don ' t even	64 72 72 72 72 36 36 36 36
different things	64 64
getting the granite or the marble unless	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
pictures stand out so obviously the	63 63 63 63 63 56
look at real estate	28 16 28 35
pay as much it ' s the truth that theater	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
created on your own in which case you	56 56 56 56 56 56 32 32
and that is to rehearse with another	56 36 36 36 36 36 63
to get even more auditions than what	36 36 72 72 72 56 32
license exam on the first try now as a	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64

smaller market might cost a little bit	64 64 64 64 63 63 63
people they just wait too long until	63 56 64 64 64 64 64
that ' s the first step figuring out as a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
before i have to join the union in fact	72 63 72 64 64 63 63 63 63

and do it yourself then look at the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
number two is to have a non distracting	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
microphone this is why I like to use	63 63 63 63 56 64 64 64
if you want to download my free audition	72 72 72 72 63 72 72 72
what I would do here is I would read	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
in the big blockbuster realm but doing	64 64 64 64 64 56 64
our team so if you guys found this video	56 56 56 20 20 20 64 64 64
the three things that he says actors	64 64 56 32 32 32 32
one is appreciation and this is when the	64 56 72 64 64 64 64 64
going to be different for every single	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
steps that it takes to cast a role in a	36 63 63 36 36 63 63 63 56 64
great workout in this you know closet	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
learn the skills you need to break into	40 40 64 64 64 72 72 72
you wanted to write now you could start	63 63 63 63 4 4 25 10
losing real money	63 63 63
this works mostly at places like	56 63 63 63 63 56
and you ' re it ' s another opportunity to	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
one of those actors in that small	63 63 63 63 63 63 72
definitely want to do that soon i just	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
three hours when people think about it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
buying multi - unit properties	56 64 64 64 64
option is la the best place to go well	72 72 64 64 64 64 72 72 63
my scenes were cut	63 63 63 63
so if you haven ' t already make sure	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 72
opportunities basically the same as an	63 72 63 63 63 63
there was one take that I remember where	36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36
I ' ll give them stuff to do so that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
audition so in a way they do decide who	36 36 36 45 36 36 36 36 63
college there are many other types of	56 63 63 56 64 64 64
working on	64 56
or can you start your career from	63 63 63 56 56 56 63
your career step 4	72 72 56 64
here in the atlanta area but if you live	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
and i ' ll link them down below i got all	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you may have to join the union before	72 72 72 72 63 63 63 64
that same $ 500 , 000 home you ' re putting	64 56 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so many kind of online courses that seem	63 63 63 63 63 63 30 30
a move is a huge financial burden unless	56 56 56 56 56 56 63 63
have to refill it right now another way	64 64 64 64 56 56 56 56
download it for free	64 64 72 48
most obvious reason is of course to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
in the industry is by doing	56 63 36 63 63 72
in full character because it ' s just not	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
as your primary residence that and you	63 63 63 63 56 64 56
headshot at your auditions well that	63 63 64 64 63 63
without going broke okay step one is	64 64 64 63 63 63 63
every single audition is memorable then	64 64 64 64 64 64
spending some time here with me today	72 72 72 72 64 72 64
yeah that ' s definitely a possibility but	64 64 64 64 64 72 72 72
most of our lives we often feel like we	24 36 36 36 32 56 56 0 4
that doesn ' t mean that it doesn ' t come	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
maintain our standard of living	24 24 63 63 63
at the workplace	0 0 0
below this really all just ties into	64 64 64 56 56 56 56
touching on a lot of the obstacles that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
helps to offset or	0 0 0 0
questions when it comes to the stuff	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
like show business right well there ' s a	63 63 63 63 63 72 72 72 56
into my email list and growing it has	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
abilities anyway	56 56
in here to achieve financial	56 63 63 63 63
of their income on housing so just think	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64
pay and get your drink versus if you	63 63 63 63 63 56 63 63
and you ' ll find that once you get	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
that you could potentially rent out some	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
properties the lender will actually use	56 56 64 64 64 56
are they going to take care of the	63 63 63 63 56 56 56 56
challenge our brains	63 63 56
when you ' re doing this they ' re not	56 32 32 32 32 32 56 56 56 56
in the thumbnail i wrote that monologues	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
this whole social media thing and that	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
habbid on ways to get and soul of the	63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64 63
quickly to the first person who applies	56 63 63 63 63 63 56
for the scene framing refers to how much	64 64 64 56 56 56 64 64
just the same way as we are as actors	63 63 63 63 64 64 64 64 64
university experts in 2018 agreed that	63 56 56 49 49 56
on self - improvement every single day	64 63 63 63 63 63 63
wasn ' t there and you know I there ' s no	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
doing photography wise but	64 64 64 64
going to make you stand out like a sore	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
until next time keep practicing keep	63 63 63 64 64 64
as hard even after you do get an agent	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
idea how to answer it but the whole	63 64 64 64 64 64 64 72
at the same time so doing that will make	56 56 63 24 63 63 72 72 63
per gallon which is about 800 times more	56 56 64 56 63 63 63 63
one simply because of the numbers they	72 63 63 63 63 63 63
in future episodes so you ' ll have to	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
is especially true in competitive	63 63 63 63 63
trying to get my agent and i wanted to	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 32 32
and education	20 28
the point where you have it maybe about	56 56 56 56 63 63 56 56
jobs the actor agent relationship is the	64 63 63 64 64 64 64
so this is why most actors really want	63 63 63 63 63 63 72 64
how to tell that whole story now if	63 63 63 63 63 63 64 40
example that are really important one I	64 40 64 64 40 40 40
ratio and we can drag it to as big as we	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
look up that particular department and	48 48 72 64 64 64
this scene that means you ' re just gonna	63 63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56
into the audition room of a film and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
finish college and go full time once i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
but hollywood the industry the industry	63 24 63 24 24 72
something else	0 0
in many scenarios to buy the home with	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
work i ' d love to see what other things	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
the union so here in north america the	24 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
commandment number eight is to have a	64 0 0 0 0 0 0
Academy and then trying to build your	0 0 0 0 40 0 0
learn those things	72 72 45
college offers them and if you ' re out of	63 63 63 63 36 63 63 63 63 63
you if you get quotes from at least five	64 56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64
at the beginning of our lives more	40 25 25 25 25 0 25
from actingcareercenter	63 63
cost too much money but they are a bit	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
look for the produce that is on sale	56 56 56 63 63 56 56 56
there were not many movies being made in	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
below and let me know which approach you	63 72 63 63 72 72 72 72
not to get an agent the first step is	72 72 48 48 72 72 72 64 56
a bunch of monologues when um when i	72 72 72 72 36 36 36 63
has a thousand or more questions that	56 56 56 64 64 64 64
passive income or some type of side	63 63 63 63 63 56 64
to be on set and to gain some experience	56 56 64 63 36 63 63 64 64
film and tv for the for the run of the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
kind of offset the colors so choose	63 63 63 63 63 63 72
excuse anymore at all if you want to	0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0
mastermind that means that instead of	63 63 63 63 63 63
need to track the things that will	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
your equity and part of that goes to	56 56 64 56 64 64 64 56
and i just feel like it ' s so much easier	36 56 56 56 32 32 32 32 56 56 32
right eye and then give you a thumbs up	8 32 63 63 63 63 63 63 36
if you were not signed with them so now	63 63 64 64 64 64 64 63 63
reduce every single word in the script	56 56 63 56 56 63 63
and fast way	63 63 63
background work on your acting resume it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you can change out the floors with lvp	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
stuff you build an audience by giving	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
time watching one of my videos	64 64 64 64 64 64
just kind of kept popping up over here	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so what is sag - aftra sag - aftra is a	72 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
don ' t get an agent right away	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 56
when these students are taking these	64 72 56 56 56 56
commission off of all union jobs sag	64 64 72 72 72 72 63
and outsource um the better your more	63 63 63 56 56 63 63
generational wealth you can have cash	56 56 56 56 56 56
cleveland ohio to atlanta georgia now	56 56 56 63 63 56
you can spend a lot of money if the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
bathroom but it actually makes a lot of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
just how big of an impact this has on	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you ' re gonna use it again in the next	56 56 56 56 63 63 56 56 56 56
important as well and that is right to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
like they are emphasized	56 56 56 56
if you ' re in that less than 10 percent	63 72 72 72 72 63 72 72 72 64
then uploads it to the casting director	36 63 63 63 63 63 36
when it kind of clicked and I was like	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just them moving a lot you absolutely	0 0 0 56 56 56 56
get information	63 63
this channel	64 63
just so you can see how this works	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ended up being offered and then they	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
watching this with say no to having an	48 72 72 48 72 72 72 72
absolutely do regret when i first	63 63 63 63 63 63
what ' s up my fellow actors welcome to	0 0 0 0 0 63 64 64 64
on the spot and they give you a little	56 32 36 36 63 63 56 56 56
nine on my list is	64 64 64 64 56
see audition please	63 63 72
your business or to push forward in your	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
section should be television credits	0 0 0 0 0
fixer - uppers and doing some of these	49 49 49 49 49 56 49 28
found out that i was	64 64 64 64 64
no one right answer to this question now	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
i think it makes them	63 63 63 63 24
important to mention that auditioning	0 64 64 64 63
the reason is the phone is a touchscreen	56 56 40 64 56 56 56 56
yourself so that you can buy and sell	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
but again it ' s not about winning the	56 42 72 72 72 72 63 63 63
start with drop shipping the basic idea	48 48 48 48 48 48 24
did see him	64 64 64
agree with more if you like this video	72 72 72 45 72 45 36 63
things that we just talked about and	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
website that link is in the description	64 36 36 63 64 64 64
the more you cram the worse your	25 20 35 20 20 35 56
important the main reason for this is	72 64 56 56 56 56 56
anywhere near as much as a day on set	63 72 72 48 48 48 48 72 72
and I read for that character after I	32 32 32 36 36 36 36 36
a much more viable long - term solution is	42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42
talk about the business of acting	63 63 63 64 64 64
money which we need to live but being	63 42 42 63 63 63 42 42
know it can be scary	63 63 63 63 63
really incredible and so beneficial to	64 64 64 64 64 63
or a star wars movie	63 63 63 63 63

work with me because i do not do	63 63 64 72 72 72 72 72
now if i lived in california or new york	56 63 63 72 72 56 56 56 56

recommended so many of my friends to use	56 56 56 56 56 56 32 56

lead character in a movie or a	36 36 64 64 64 56 56
can do is try and find a co - signer and	56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63

in that market and you might be able to	72 72 72 64 64 64 64 64 64
now that the casting director has	56 56 56 56 63 63
someone hasn ' t told us that we	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

typically a casting director will reach	63 63 63 24 24 24
you can use that loss to offset other	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to do with permit laws and rental rates	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
financials your cash reserves all that	63 63 56 56 63 63

the casting director is looking at a sea	63 72 72 24 24 42 42 42
property i knew that the renovations	63 63 56 56 56 0
copy beforehand so let ' s say you go to	63 63 36 36 36 36 36 36 36 36
companies can charge as much as 30	63 56 56 56 63 63 63
twice as much alright another thing is	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
think about when you ' re considering	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
family and your friends will likely use	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
ask you to say your name in your height	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 40 40

in the united states you are either a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in that way my website and make it an	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
what i mean by that i mean that	56 64 64 64 64 64 72 63
cheat sheet you can go to it by clicking	64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
extremely uncomfortable for a lot of	56 63 63 63 63 63
cost some money in order to upload	56 56 56 56 32 32 32
because that ' s what I wanted to talk	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
from a talent agency is another huge	63 63 63 63 56 56 56
book either of those roles that i	64 64 64 64 64 63 63
reviews about the best electronics in	42 63 63 63 72 72
november 6 the day that we shot the	25 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
even though I had just personally	64 64 56 32 56 64
find things that are on sale big stores	56 56 56 64 56 56 56 56
him based on another live	32 32 32 64 64
what your intent is and just know that i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
your life so that ' s why it ' s so	64 72 63 63 63 63 72 72 72 72 72
first try all right I ' ll see you guys in	63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
that could match those expenses you have	63 63 63 63 72 72 63
as an actor is a little bit different	25 25 64 72 72 72 72 64
research a great place to ask that	64 32 32 32 32 56 56
don ' t have an agent you would just put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and all the different factors you should	64 64 56 56 56 56 64
youtube i can literally go on a trip and	56 16 16 16 49 49 49 49 49
to define but what ' s always going to be	63 63 36 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
what ' s up my fellow actors welcome to	0 0 0 0 0 64 64 64 64
the general public so	63 64 64 64
the commercial	56 36
the three columns here are again the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
offers you representation before anybody	36 32 32 36 36
that we talked about	63 63 63 63
expenses you guys should be expensing	63 32 32 20 32 63
Express the course that I used in the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
my first audition and my callback and	42 42 63 63 72 64 63
programs are going to be making student	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
auditions from home well let me share	64 64 64 64 64 63 63
someone is making over 50 thousand	56 32 56 56 56 56
topics so yeah overall an extremely	64 56 56 42 56 56
what happens a lot is that the character	56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
say blocks	63 63
part with their hard - earned cash to buy	72 72 72 56 56 56 24 63 24
what projects i ' m working on so i ' ve had	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
i don ' t know what cast and websites are	56 63 63 63 72 72 72 72 72 63
I ' d recommend starting with the basics	48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48
talking about the	24 24 63
how the casting process works	56 56 56 24 24
background is actually a great example	63 63 63 63 63 63
couple of years until you ' re 18 and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
deductions the real secret sauce with	56 56 63 63 63 63
lott if you single still make up and	64 64 64 64 63 63 63 63
creativity and potential revenue and	63 63 63 63 63
don ' t buy as much clothes	56 56 56 56 72 64 56
personally do real estate part - time i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
actors access you can actually get an	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
don ' t you ' re going to really hate your	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
i think i would have freaked out if i if	64 64 64 64 64 40 40 40 40 40
you can help you know help people find	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on a certain date or something like that	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
not just in the background you	36 24 24 24 24 63
to determine whether or not you have to	63 63 56 56 56 63 63 63
make 130	20 56
can get a lot of really great workouts	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you ' re going to make a lot more money on	64 64 64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64
want to understand the financials of	72 72 72 72 72 72
haven ' t already and if you ' re a newer	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
of using the paintbrush does play an	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
this house and kind of the steps I took	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
need anything close to 20 % when you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
prepare for buying your first home	56 63 63 63 63 56
what happened and now i ' m currently	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
money and time on your self	28 16 20 16 28 20
definitely help you in preparing for	72 72 63 63 63 63
soon as possible since you ' re able to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64
was one of the main characters maybe he	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
hard to get clients for this first six	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
because remember there are 50 other	63 56 56 56 56 56
accountable you ' re gonna have classmates	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
it kind of shows it looks like time pass	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it didn ' t really occur to me how	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after television would be film	0 0 0 0 0
or a television show i ' ll break down the	56 56 56 63 36 36 36 9 9 9
that ' s just the reality of it and by job	63 63 63 63 63 72 56 56 56 56 56
either choose 4 inch or 6 inch lights	63 63 63 72 72 63 63 63
before they can try to get to play into	8 32 32 8 8 8 8 32 32
it allows people to leverage money at	25 64 56 56 56 64 56
coffee and most people get their daily	63 56 56 56 56 63 56
the drama classes that are available	64 64 63 36 63 63
seen a huge investment come back	63 63 63 63 63 63
uninterested on	64 64
ago I published a video titled	63 63 64 64 64 64
that you ' ll convert meaning p you know	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 48 30
and i was eventually booked on october	36 36 63 64 64 64 64
logos making whatever it is that they	72 72 72 63 63 63 63
their bank accounts and they wonder	32 32 56 56 56 0
professional headshot an agent may ask	64 64 72 72 56 56
put all the headshots of their top	63 3 3 3 6 6 6
so I was like you know what let ' s see if	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so here we write either lead supporting	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I ' ve done for the last eight hours or so	56 56 56 56 36 24 24 36 36 63 63
popular show I ' ve ever worked on it	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56
going to move on to the next person who	32 32 32 32 32 32 64 64 64
mostly through the attention that I	24 42 32 42 48 30
yourself for those couple months you can	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
states you can see that the average	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
don ' t have another person to rehearse	32 32 32 32 32 32 56 56
money to pay for the class pay for your	63 63 63 63 56 63 63 63 63
they decided to just choose from the	56 56 64 64 64 56 56
the project to the producers so that is	72 72 72 72 72 63 63 63
that you really want to nail down is	63 63 56 63 63 63 63 63
to work on	72 64 64
i haven ' t seen it yet but some of my	64 56 56 56 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
tuned hey guys it ' s Kurt from	0 0 63 56 56 56 56 64
was financially stable with my other	63 63 63 63 63 63
recommend is going online buying a book	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
so many casting directors talk about	63 63 63 63 63 63
so you got to make sure your headshot is	72 63 63 63 63 72 72 63 63
guest star	0 0
directly that ' s why it is so important	64 64 64 64 64 56 64 64 64
old but the owners of this house just a	63 63 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
will fail within the first two years and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
diet free beat trap the game by going to	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
because I can feel where the buttons are	36 32 32 32 32 32 56 72
audition or set like they know and so I	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
step 8 is the casting director reviewing	63 63 72 72 72 72 63
but like they say luck is when	63 63 63 72 63 63 63
information about the whole process all	63 63 63 63 63 63
bit if you had any confusion about how	56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64
and to the costume itself could be a	63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
talk and you also get to listen so when	32 32 32 32 32 32 56 32 32
my suggestion	56 56
your character would be wearing but you	56 56 56 56 56 64 64
your career	56 64
until next time keep practicing keep	63 63 63 40 64 64

hey kurt give me a status hey shaq this	63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64
after you take the course make sure you	40 40 25 25 25 25 64 64
months to find a property and get your	56 64 56 63 64 64 56 56
classes that you can be taking to	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
aware of that now if you ' re looking for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56 63
get an agent in the future	32 32 32 32 32 36

hoops you could be just you could be	36 9 9 9 8 8 8 8

for my auditions I don ' t use all seven	63 56 56 56 64 64 64 56 56 56
that you are looking at now when you	56 56 56 56 56 72 72 72

where you have three rentable units	63 56 63 63 63 63
rate when you do apply	72 64 64 64 64
so if you are a non - union actor you are	72 72 72 72 64 72 72 72 72 72 72

you ' re paying taxes upfront and with the	35 35 35 49 20 49 49 20 20
you put in there you can look at past	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
turnkey properties third is you must	56 56 63 35 35 56
your brand like all of those things are	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
real estate agents could have a youtube	63 63 63 63 56 56 56
that most people don ' t have too much	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and do you need to move anywhere at all	56 64 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
saving me a ton of money in the process	56 35 35 56 56 56 56 56 56
and if you have any questions remember	63 63 63 63 63 63 64
the front and then on the back should be	63 63 72 72 72 63 63 63 36
free basically if you ' re subscribed to	63 63 64 64 64 64 64 64
will typically see a lot of storyboards	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they say hey can I see you on your one	40 32 36 36 63 63 72 36 36 36

photographers like family photographers	72 72 72 63
examples of times when my scenes were	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
this particular youtube channel is	63 56 56 56 63
you just didn ' t necessarily fit those	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
interested in learning about my audition	64 64 64 64 72 64
the house without actually coming here	0 0 0 0 0 0
i mean to be completely honest i think	72 72 63 63 72 63 63 63
get more auditions for this show why	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
instead of getting a script	56 56 64 64 56
a terrible standardization because every	0 0 0 0 0
is looking at you and you say i want	63 63 63 56 63 64 64 64 56
didn ' t want to have to create all that	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
much as a principal performer but you	64 64 64 64 64 63 63
money from the seller you can ask them	56 56 64 56 64 64 64 64
and that is that you can offer to work	72 36 36 9 36 36 36 36 36
that ' s how you get your real estate	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it is pretty scary not having money in	64 64 72 72 56 56 56 56
from that do have demo reels that they	63 63 63 63 42 42 42 63
you know i did well on them but i didn	64 64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56

boost of about $ 175 , 000 so I want you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
labor union here in the united states	64 64 64 63 63 56 64
thing you can expect to pay for	64 64 72 72 63 63 56
know like reading every word	56 56 64 64 64
role in a movie so i was	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
so it really is in your favor to have	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they ' re going to expect you to have some	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
your only thing especially if you are in	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
honest most of the information found in	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
independent films and short films	64 56 56 56 64
i wasn ' t released i got good news i	63 63 63 63 63 64 56 56 64 64
happen to fit well then your chances are	63 63 63 63 63 72 64 64
on that so fifteen thousand dollars	56 56 56 56 56 56
theater they want to be	72 72 81 81 63
other countries but i have no experience	56 64 63 63 63 63 64

many casting directors will hold	63 63 63 63 63
do with that	63 63 63
and then just go like that back and	63 35 36 56 35 56 32 56

when they look at something like this	32 32 56 56 56 32 32
completely in this case fifteen point	63 56 56 56 56 56
just ready to rock it but right before	63 63 64 64 64 64 63 63
card or the instant you have a bill	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 42
how many actors are auditioning for the	64 63 63 63 63 63 63
nebulous concept	63 63

many other people think you cannot the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

there you will find commercials on there	64 64 64 64 64 64 64

they are finding local	63 63 63 63

at its core money is just a medium for	25 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
encourage you to watch this	64 64 64 64 64
those were my top 20 terms that you will	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
live and whether or not your location	72 63 63 63 63 63 63

other factors that we don ' t have any	48 48 48 72 72 72 72 63 63

audition classes stunt classes stage	63 63 63 56 56
california i have my own investment	25 25 25 25 25 0
license I got mine in two months so all	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
are the pages of the script associated	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
you in the next video peace	63 63 63 63 0 0

really popular alone that people can get	63 56 56 56 56 56 56
now one more thing that i want to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
pinpoint okay like when i made that	63 63 63 63 63 56 63
networks cost 25	56 56 56
will pass if you go through all their	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
question why because your ability to	63 63 63 63 63 63
helps other people to see my channel it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
these five tips these are the things	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

become a full - time actor in Ohio okay if	63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64 63 63
have a huge advantage it ' s very hard for	72 72 72 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
of the members just be like hey gee can	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
was going to be important later on	32 32 32 36 36 36 63
so cast yourself create your own content	64 64 63 64 56 64 64
stand a reader is the person who is	64 64 56 64 64 64 64 40
it could be chest up it could be waist	24 24 24 24 24 24 24 48 63
on the item so for example let ' s say we	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63 63
is that it is a film competition that	64 64 64 72 63 63 63 63

a lot more in this video we are focusing	64 64 72 64 64 56 64 64 72
because before they moved in or sorry	72 72 63 63 63 63 63
may need to think about is whether or	64 64 64 64 64 56 56 56
want to on set they don ' t have to follow	56 56 56 63 72 72 72 72 72 64 72
really depends on the lender that you go	56 63 63 63 56 56 56 56

what that means	63 63 63
it really blows my mind to see how far	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
was totally caught off guard by it the	64 64 63 64 64 64 64 64
background work or being an extra now	64 56 56 56 56 56 56
contractors that i work with so you know	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

lightly and it should not be made on a	63 64 64 64 64 64 63 63 63
away ready step number one is to do some	64 64 0 56 64 64 63 63 63
you can schedule a test date and then	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56

at this price ever like this is the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
instead of an actor you were a graphic	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
a priority to me in my business not just	64 64 64 64 64 64 63 63 63
your services over the Internet now I	45 72 72 42 30 30 30

would i have had the same amount of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
certainly is not required	63 63 63 36
dollars in the last year with your	56 49 28 56 56 35 56
all right we got a lot to cover in this	64 72 72 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
two movies and recurring on a netflix	56 56 72 64 64 64 64
they just weren ' t prepared	56 63 63 63 63 63
one i would recommend everybody watch it	0 0 0 0 0 36 36
state currently	63 63
and yeah the way that they ask things	63 42 24 56 72 64 64 56
my clients but if they don ' t implement	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what ' s that ninety percent well that is	56 56 56 56 56 72 72 72 72
from there and you	64 64 63 63
lows during an activation email and the	64 63 63 63 63 64 64
you on your first deal if you ' re in	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
whenever you want	63 63 56
part of this	64 64 64
isn ' t to hear you [UNK] [UNK] about	64 64 64 32 56 56 56 56 56
they go directly to agents and will not	56 32 56 56 32 64 72 81
and they ' re trying to get a gauge of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
have always been	56 63 36
may not book future roles and sometimes	56 56 56 63 63 63 63
broken 22 bones I ' ve separated his	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a net surplus of about 300 so this is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on your down payment there are a ton of	56 56 49 49 49 56 56 56 63
scary to think about but um the biggest	63 63 63 63 63 63 72 63
not always but it is a system that if	63 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 56
where the actor goes into the casting	63 36 36 36 36 63 63
in New York City and you can do the same	64 64 64 64 64 56 64 64 64 64

if they should go to college and major	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
what i would recommend is doing a scene	64 64 64 56 56 56 56 32
it comes down to it you know just meal	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
own children and they ' re under 18 years	56 63 56 56 56 56 63 63 56

they ' re not eating the same things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but in the beginning	72 72 72 72
don ' t have to follow any of those rules	56 56 56 56 56 63 64 64 64 64
have some health complications	72 63 72 64

roles that need to be cast for this	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
example let ' s say there ' s a new movie	64 64 64 64 56 63 63 63 63 56 56
in atlanta who ' s a friend of mine his	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 40 64 64
local actors because when they hire	56 56 32 32 32 32
the reason being if you go into a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
commercial print model	56 56 64
is a marathon not a sprint you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
filmmaking so for example let ' s say you	56 63 63 63 32 32 32 32 63
an agent	56 32
single week now it ' s actually been more	64 64 64 72 72 72 72 72 64
city you currently live in	63 63 63 63 63
so that ' s how i found out that shaq was	45 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
auditioned for this commercial with shaq	64 64 64 64 64 64
on the project and	63 63 72 72
beginning of them correct yes we ' re in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

especially this month this has been the	72 72 64 40 40 64 64
practicing keep learning and I hope to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and they were frugal on pretty much	56 56 63 63 63 63 63
new york city and atlanta those are the	56 56 63 63 63 63 56 63
tell me about your dog well guess what	56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64
to make that happen and i say that fully	64 63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
auditioning and career advice every week	72 72 72 63 72 63
especially when you factor in the time	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
that week the more flexible you are with	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63
but first let me just play a clip of the	64 63 24 24 24 64 64 64 64 64
imdb page and it ' s right there i ' ll put	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 36 36 36 36 36
unfortunately it ' s not that simple	63 63 63 63 72 63 63
it looks like this is the big kitchen	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and if it ' s a high profile project they	63 56 63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56
more complete way than what it ' s used to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and get feedback	56 64 64
the line and so for me right now I ' m at	42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 35 35 35 35
and that ' s a tough thing right now	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
opportunities available	63 63
fits each role so for simplicity ' s sake	32 32 32 64 63 63 63 63 63
acting resumes so in this video i	72 72 72 72 72 72 63
keeping people poor	0 0 0
instance every year thousands and	64 56 56 56 56
and you are a sag - aftra member now	36 32 36 36 56 56 56 63 63
so if that happens they are taking their	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
adding a couple lines uh they added a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

i started my acting career in cleveland	63 63 64 64 64 64 64
but it ' s very hard to become a good one	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
marketing there are a million different	63 63 63 63 63 63
my experience and my advice	56 56 56 56 56
sheet that ' s basically the 10 step	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72

on social media a lot of times they	56 64 64 72 72 72 72 63
independence then hit the playlist over	56 32 32 32 56 56

drive to a physical classroom every day	63 63 63 56 63 63 63
little bit about	63 63 63
is really helpful because I don ' t have	56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63

you for your services essentially	63 63 63 63 24
for the theater side of your career	36 36 36 36 36 36 64
of when you have someone with experience	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
again so I found doing this to be really	56 64 64 56 64 64 64 64 64
it doesn ' t matter	64 64 64 64 64
interest now whatever money you	72 72 56 56 56

to help us live happier more productive	72 63 63 63 72 72 72
but if you are someone like me who is	72 72 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
not the case here in atlanta	63 56 56 56 56 56
this is the will of working and	64 64 64 64 63 56 64

it ' s because it extends much further	24 24 24 24 24 24 24 25
basically what you want whether it ' s a	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63
standpoint that ' s all you ' ve broken 22	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

that hundred thousand dollar profit	56 56 56 56 56
audition on camera this is an excellent	63 63 64 56 56 56 56
next thing you guys should definitely do	36 36 32 32 56 56 56
every audition that i get how i make	56 56 56 64 56 56 56 56
to talk about this for a reason of	56 56 64 56 56 56 56 56
know as actors because if you ' re in an	64 64 64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56

but in my experience in my 12 years as	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 36
involved and audition for	56 56 63 72

which is my 10 - step audition preparation	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
again if someone is inexperienced	63 63 63 63 63
the biggest difference between a	64 72 72 72 72
person giving the script to somebody	63 63 32 32 32 32
talent agents a few months ago i made a	64 64 64 64 63 63 63 63 63
without an agent and even when you do	63 63 63 63 63 63 36 32

already you definitely want to subscribe	64 64 72 72 72 72
you say it that ' s why I like to talk	64 64 56 64 64 64 72 72 72 64 72

occasionally i will have more than 48	63 63 56 56 56 56 56
footage that we can use for ourselves	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
is to prove to them that you already	72 72 72 63 63 63 63 63
different things it makes sense that	0 0 35 64 56 63
decision for you	64 36 63

non - union productions that have made me	64 64 64 64 56 56 56 56
keep practicing keep	64 64 64
don ' t have to do in your business	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and fifty dollars and that can get	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
union contract	56 63
their website and their phone number and	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
get it it went to somebody else right	42 42 63 63 63 63 63 63
so your part needs to be able to fit	63 63 63 56 56 56 56 63 63
heart of a girl thing well i	64 72 56 56 56 63 72
not someone who doesn ' t look like this	63 63 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
you ' re just eating by yourself and	20 20 20 20 20 20 20 56
we in the industry don ' t need to hear	63 63 63 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
don ' t know	64 64 64 64
everyone to begin with and it was how I	25 25 25 25 25 0 0 0 25
afraid that they they ' re gonna let	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
websites submit your headshot	56 56 56 56
is I think a much easier way that anyone	0 0 0 0 48 48 48 48 72
keep doing that but until you have that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
end of every course you take a final	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
with Sarah ' s character for audition	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
going to that link right there alright	35 35 35 35 63 64 63

way you make money through real estate	72 72 72 64 64 64 64
sag after a website	64 64 64 64

sales and letting your people know about	72 63 63 63 63 63 63

to check with people in your market to	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
those are all extra expenses for the	63 72 72 72 72 72 72
and everything because I just wanted a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
get a tax deduction as i could	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
the us and i ' m sure in many other	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
week well in a week that ' s 35	56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
actor by doing these things you can also	72 64 64 64 72 72 64 64
look like a professional actor and not	56 64 64 64 64 64 64
literally hundreds of services you can	0 0 0 0 0 0
do much else and to be honest it	63 56 42 42 42 42 42 56
casting websites like actors access and	63 63 63 72 72 72
we can keep a folder of headshots in our	72 72 72 56 63 56 63 72 72
that can get me onto a team that sounds	32 32 32 56 56 56 64 63 63
is horizontal many of you will want to	0 0 0 63 72 64 64 64
the building where we would be filming	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
the LTV the more risky that loan is	56 56 56 63 56 56 56 56
bluish light it ' s more like something	63 72 63 63 63 56 63 63
i guarantee you you ' re going to save	63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
nothing scripted so i recorded my	63 63 56 63 63 64
one of the best ways to build long	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
video if you liked it please give it a	56 40 40 64 64 72 72 64 64
and by the way this example resume that	64 64 32 36 63 56 56 56
frame it from mid - [UNK] to the top of	8 5 5 16 16 16 16 16 8 8
movies and television shows	64 64 64 63
like the cost of incorporating if you	63 63 63 64 63 63 63
and for good reason it ' s the most	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 56 64
unlimited amounts of money then move	63 63 63 63 63 63
10 years	49 56
had i gone to la if anything it would	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
succeed I want you to be that series	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I ' ve worked on then I ' ve created a free	64 64 64 64 64 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
finish of the paper you have the choice	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
inches wide by 10 inches tall now this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
products i think that ' s super ridiculous	63 56 56 56 56 56 56 63
be something that you should think about	56 56 64 64 72 63 63
a brand new actor who ' s just starting	63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
before most people aren ' t putting down	64 63 63 56 56 56 56 56
making it at home you actually have to	63 56 56 63 63 63 63 63
strategies that you should use as well	35 20 16 16 16 20 20
other and I couldn ' t even I couldn ' t fit	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i found out that i got another audition	40 40 40 40 40 64 64 64
footage back that you can put onto your	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
sustainability standpoint yeah that	0 0 0 0
characters and that ' s why we offered you	63 72 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
once a year but here ' s a situation where	63 63 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
using props and auditions ok so what	64 64 64 64 72 63 63
definitely go for it but there are	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
telling you in this video of creating	63 63 63 63 42 63 63
looking on hot pads and seeing what	64 56 56 56 56 64 64
are getting paid so	56 56 56 56
8x10 photo paper	63 63 63
but i truly i think it is i think you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
highlights from some of my favorite	56 56 56 56 56 56
to your actual shoot on time they can	36 36 36 36 63 63 63 63
if they interviewed a basketball player	72 64 64 64 64 64
a a person that works at a coffee shop	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
they can help you out and buying your	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
sandwiches okay so my actual response	64 63 63 64 64 64
shopping for your loan	56 49 49 49
course i ' m cheering for you guys	63 63 63 63 63 56 56 56
for other parts a lot of these are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your nearest medical school and then	56 56 64 56 56 56
of what you are responding to this	36 36 36 32 56 63 64
and you ' ve prepared for this audition to	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
to increase stability in my body I want	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then sending it electronically to	32 32 32 63 72 72
house so there ' s one bedroom [UNK]	63 63 40 40 40 0 0 0
so for a couple examples when i had my	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the moment you get your offer accepted	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
employee contribution this is the	56 56 35 56 63
but what i have found to be like out of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
dvd so if somebody buys a dvd of a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
generally an	56 56
likely have a personal car	32 32 32 56 56
controlling ourselves so here there	0 0 0 0 0
video or photo and turn it into amazing	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
actual state exam so go through these	56 56 56 56 42 63 56
more money does not lead to more	36 36 36 63 63 63 72
hundred dollars to three hundred dollars	63 63 63 63 56 64
actors contacting them asking for	64 63 64 64 64
for epson they were shooting	64 64 64 36 36
acting auditioning and career advice	56 64 64 64 64
really effective when I do them together	56 64 64 56 64 64 63
uh chicago new york atlanta and some of	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
networking door	56 56
that we ' re only talking about sag after	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
have you been doing everything that you	63 63 63 72 72 72 72
it ' s still a heck of a lot better than	63 63 63 64 64 64 56 56 56 63 64
recommend you learning how to code is	42 63 63 63 63 64 24
almost four years now I want to say is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
cheaper but they ' re also gonna be a lot	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
if I hadn ' t been as prepared as I was it	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
until next time keep practicing keep	63 63 63 63 45 72
video and i think this is going to be	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
showed us where we would be sitting and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 24
not gonna make you watch me write write	63 63 63 36 36 63 36 63
can do what I do which is to have	72 72 63 36 36 36 63 36 36
little bit weird like stephanie like	63 63 63 63 63 63
monologue practicing your accents	0 0 0 0
and according to the commercial	64 64 64 64 56
working on that show because they are	63 63 63 63 63 63 36
the third thing you guys have to know is	56 35 56 56 49 49 49 49 56
and most of that time was spent just	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
piece uh to see your acting ability and	72 72 72 72 64 64 63 32
now i ' m not talking about being like a	63 63 63 63 63 63 72 72 72 63
getting pre - approved for a residential	56 56 56 56 56 56 64
about yourself in an audition all right	63 64 64 63 63 64 63
really when you think about having a big	56 24 24 24 24 24 24 24
more importantly it ' s gonna look a lot	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

a payment just because you forgot to	63 63 63 63 63 63 64
get your stuff out there so that people	24 63 36 36 36 63 63 63
are some people out there that think	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
i think at one point or another all of	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
might want to change and have almost	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

remodel can range anywhere from a few	72 72 63 72 72 72 63
make money online magnifies a lot	36 36 63 63 40 24

moving to one of the major production	63 72 72 72 72 63 64
let ' s get to it self taping commandment	63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64
on scenes together that ' s such an	64 64 64 63 63 63 63 63
for the deputies part everybody had it	63 36 36 36 56 56 56
on the first try	64 64 64 64
then i ' ve created a free audition cheat	63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64 64
imdb profile but you don ' t need to do	63 72 72 56 63 63 63 63 72 63
then let me know down in the comments	36 63 63 63 72 64 64 64
is a different version of this that	63 63 63 72 72 72 72
i don ' t think that is the smartest way	56 56 56 56 35 56 63 63 64 56
particularly useful either recently or	0 0 0 0 0
male or female so that ' s the character	56 56 63 32 20 20 20 20 56
these other factors	72 72 35
until next time keep practicing keep	64 64 64 64 64 64
your internet and if it ' s not something	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63
first one	64 64
i have never once in my entire 13	25 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
a similar commercial	63 63 63
how much you spend in your business how	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and then there was a patient and a nurse	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
actors can make money within this	64 64 64 56 56 56
personally have seen	64 56 56
student films and non - union indie films	63 56 64 64 64 64 64 72
about next so cool because people	0 0 0 0 0 0
that there are actors that move to the	63 72 64 72 72 72 72 72
i ' ve i audition for it anyway and then	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
less than 20 % down and like I said	63 63 63 63 63 63 72 72 72
either the industry or I have presented	0 0 0 0 0 0 40
be doing a lot of real estate investing	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
and understand the importance before	63 63 63 63 56
agent then	63 63
home for yourself	64 64 64
hey let ' s pick up where we left off you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they ' ve made the move here	72 72 72 64 64 64 64
i recommend you just go to google and do	56 56 56 64 64 64 64 64 64
see a positive balance and be able to	56 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
it ' s all useful information to have if	56 56 56 63 56 56 56 56 56
side when they ' re watching your demo	36 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
during my first year of business at a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
having a yard is incredibly hard and	56 56 56 56 63 63 56
say like i started my business as a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
representation finding representation	64 63 63
can change the colors to whatever color	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and then finally i think the last thing	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
where I was able to get out of that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is like where is my concept of enough	0 0 36 36 36 36 36 63
never even auditioned for that movie	63 63 64 64 64 64
that off and get into character I mean	25 25 64 64 64 64 64 36
sure I had them down when one of the	64 63 63 63 56 56 56 64 64
commercial for your acting ability and	63 63 63 63 63 63
all of those people every time that they	63 63 63 63 63 72 63 63
but there are going to be other people	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
in order to support their acting career	42 42 42 42 42 42 42
as an employee since you ' re also the	20 56 56 56 32 32 32 20 49
that i want you guys	63 63 63 56 64
about it as one of the first stepping	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
was actually working on an independent	64 64 64 64 64 64
groups in the Los Angeles Orange County	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
because i don ' t fit this character	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
wasn ' t auditioning for film and tv so it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
pretty kind of magical system really but	36 36 36 45 45 72 63
which allows you to calculate your cap	28 16 16 16 16 16 16
the website for the exact number and	64 64 64 64 64 63 63
impulsive now to combat this	56 63 63 63 63
audition right there on the spot that	36 63 63 63 63 36 63
instead of writing that you could write	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
people my age who are looking out of	36 63 63 56 56 20 49 49
every year only a very small percentage	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
that completely changed my relationship	63 63 63 72 72
the optimal score you should be looking	56 56 56 56 56 64 56
feel free to drop them below but	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
neighborhood you can send a cold emails	63 63 63 63 24 24 63
you ' ve read the summaries of	56 56 56 56 56 56 63
percent down so this VA loan greatly	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
off of monologues and onto other aspects	72 72 72 20 56 56 64

sheet you can get it by going to that	48 48 24 24 24 24 24 24 48

just out in a vacuum by itself so it	16 16 16 16 16 20 64 63 63
getting your real estate license in my	63 72 63 63 63 63 63
willing to pay for so there ' s basically	63 63 63 24 72 63 63 63 63
that come up during escrow that make you	63 63 63 63 56 63 63 63
video and that was my	63 63 63 63 63
currently the fee to join sag	63 63 56 63 63 63
me know down in the comments and give me	32 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
extra we ' re talking about auditions for	72 72 72 72 63 63 63 63
lot of fantastic information that people	0 0 0 0 0 0
seen this approach work for some actors	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it ' s a one - time three thousand dollar	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
dollars more per year right now rather	64 56 56 56 64 64 56
one huge lesson about auditioning that	64 64 64 64 64 64
was the path that my career took	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
ninety percent of the work is still on	72 63 64 64 72 72 72 72
leave them down in the comments below	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
handful of others as well	64 64 64 64 64
that still have a full - time job and keep	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
two on my list is	42 63 56 56 56
and these are the tips tricks and study	48 48 64 64 64 64 64 56
we ' re going to change this to 8 by 10 to	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
broker that employs you hangs your	63 63 63 63 63 63
mistakes like printing our headshots on	63 63 63 63 63 63
so best case scenario let ' s say that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
blone programs out there that let you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they don ' t make that final decision so	64 56 56 56 64 64 64 56 56

anywhere in the world no matter what	63 63 63 63 56 56 63
actor friends that live here	63 63 64 64 56

of these things have a one - time cost of	0 64 64 64 64 0 0 0 0 64
let ' s say you want to put down 10 % using	56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63 56 56 56 56
something like that whereas with this	63 63 63 63 36 36
you need to be providing 25 pieces of	56 63 63 63 63 63 72 56
yeah yeah	0 0

and you saw all those movies and	63 63 64 64 64 64 63
into the agency ' s office asking for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
later all right thank you so much for	64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56

a reason why most people just never	63 63 63 63 63 56 56

the audition room	56 56 63
so how do we do that and that ' s where	42 42 42 42 42 42 56 56 56 56 64
there for new agents for example keller	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

auditioning for the role well I ' d say	64 64 64 64 64 63 63 63 63
on your bidding strategy i ' ve heard	63 63 56 64 64 64 64 56
that and jump on that opportunity	63 63 63 63 63 64
about stand - in work	56 56 56 56 56
i ' ve never lived in hollywood	72 72 72 72 72 63 56

obviously recover as well but then the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on camera with the lights and everything	63 63 63 63 56 56 63
want to do is you want to be top of mind	42 42 63 63 63 63 56 56 63 56 56
are lower where the pressure is lower	63 63 63 63 63 72 63
optional though alright that ' s it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the hinges and all the knobs the handles	64 63 63 63 63 63 56 63
into the weeds of all that but i will	56 56 56 56 56 72 72 72 30
open house and when you put a house on	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

that tipping point where you can ' t keep	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and other types of investments because	56 56 56 56 56 56
highly recommend it because when you	64 64 64 64 64 56

yes house hacking is less comfortable	63 56 56 56 63 63
i mean think about this imagine if a	56 56 56 56 64 64 64 64

they ' re gonna spend a ton of time on	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
mastermind so with a hot seat style	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
going to be way more effective once	64 64 56 56 56 56 56
it would have been a totally different	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

if I have an audition tomorrow	56 56 32 32 32 32
in the scene	63 63 63
easier to clean you need	56 56 56 56 56
but it is a way that you can make money	72 72 45 45 45 72 64 64 64 64
kind of at that point where you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
give me a thumbs up remember to	63 63 63 63 36 63 63
we also want to make sure they can see	63 63 63 42 24 24 24 24 30

with dialogue they will never ask you to	36 64 64 64 64 64 64 64

experience especially when you ' re just	64 64 63 63 63 63 63
finance investing in entrepreneurship	25 25 25 63
to know that i went full time my	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
different gender than you this happens	63 63 63 63 63 63
I got the audition it was for a police	63 40 40 64 40 25 40 64 64
for a while you can start building up a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

commercials as well	56 56 56
to date it ' s still one of the most	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64
and then it was student films and indie	32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
is the average over time over hundreds	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
doing four hours per day	56 64 64 63 35
mention is that the vast majority of	63 63 63 56 56 56 56

ask yourself this do I currently own a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
differences for sure but in general	72 72 72 36 63 63
that you can remember all this	32 32 56 56 64 56
liked for that particular role	56 56 56 56 56
monologues are used quite a bit but i	36 36 36 36 63 64 72 72
oh three day diets or three day three	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
see their behind the scenes and just see	64 72 72 72 63 42 72 72
it ' s on your casting profiles or it ' s on	56 56 56 56 56 56 35 35 56 56 56 56
into two the first	63 63 36 63
presentation matters your marketing	64 64 64 63
saving a ton of money most americans are	63 63 63 63 63 56 63 63
this is a really great way to build your	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
single week	63 64
it looks looks like a nice dream and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
for a bank account	64 64 56 56
the description of this video so that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
audition should you dress as the	64 64 32 64 64 64
really prioritize saving	63 63 63
they ' ve done plays since they were in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and that can draw lots of attention yeah	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
you today is to do an activity while	63 24 64 56 63 63 63 63
on set	40 40
you know with these classes I ' m trying	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in a place that is not a tiny little	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
brother so I have to know like it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you reach 20 % equity you can just get	63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
but it ' s really not going to help you	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
guys taxes are very complicated	56 56 56 56 56
and then telling that to the agent	36 36 36 36 72 72 36
available now for example	63 63 56 56
on an acting resume all right moving on	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so it ' s getting an agent like walking	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
argue that it ' s for business or it	28 49 16 16 16 28 28 49 49
that case your PMI payment is going to	56 56 49 56 56 56 56 56
every single week today we ' re talking	72 72 64 72 63 63 63 63
until noon I no matter what I wake up	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
or a production so a performer an actor	56 56 56 72 72 72 72 72
if i can ' t get work right it ' s kind of a	32 20 56 56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63 56 36 36
and all they did was they wrote their	64 63 64 56 56 56 56 56
dialog of the computer select 8 by 10 as	0 0 0 0 64 64 64 64 64
the filmmaking industry but also a	0 0 0 0 0 0
mastermind members and that like has	63 63 63 63 63 63
of our life energy is devoted to our	63 63 63 63 63 63 56 56
never auditioning for just that one role	64 64 64 64 64 64 24
working on lower budget projects where	72 63 63 63 63 63
easier and if you guys are really	56 56 64 64 64 64 56
it ' s not about the pursuit of happiness	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
everyone needs to do i see too many	56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
so originally they wanted me as the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
lender in your area tell them about your	0 0 64 64 63 72 72 63
there are these things you need to know	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they were brand new	36 36 36 36
and if you ' re interested in learning	63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64
in new york or los angeles i would have	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
might want to say i ' m going to create x	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
prepare for that audition then I go in	72 72 72 72 32 32 32 8
any other job so what ' s the difference	63 63 64 64 56 56 56 56 56
their first auditions	63 63 63
hook is when you ask them for something	72 48 48 48 64 64 40 45
seven or eight days and we got six	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you learn the skills you need to break	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
exterior of the house right at sunset so	56 63 0 0 0 0 0 0
the paper size and matte or glossy photo	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
that being an actor is like running your	63 64 64 64 63 64 64 72
hit some roadblocks where you don ' t know	63 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
moment before action was called before	64 40 64 64 64 72
i ' m here in atlanta a medical school	64 64 64 64 64 72 64 72 72
but that ' s only been the past few years	63 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
home so we ' re gonna use that as the	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 63
and with equipment the cool thing is	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
of my film and TV auditions are on tape	64 64 64 64 64 64 63 63 56
building your network your entire career	0 0 0 0 0 0
kind of like a commercial it ' s a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
die per se no he have to die okay how	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
talent agent can be really helpful	63 63 72 72 72 72
help make sure that doesn ' t happen is to	56 56 56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
now don ' t worry if your demo reel is	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64
headshot you don ' t want to be the actor	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
answering them on the	64 64 64 64
houses before so I do have some	0 63 63 63 63 63 63
ask for recommendations for acting	56 63 63 63 63
thousands tens of thousands even	63 63 63 63 63
this can be a great way to take your	56 56 56 56 56 56 32 63 56
really nice and they ' re luxurious but	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
stressful a lot of things are out of	56 63 63 63 63 56 56 32
theater job	63 63
the way an agent actually gets paid is	72 64 64 72 64 64 64 72
let ' s flip that around and i want you to	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
kitchen is probably the most important	63 63 63 63 63 63
them in this video	64 64 64 64
in our bodies throughout our four	0 0 0 0 0 0
i can just wait for my agent to call	3 3 6 63 32 40 40 8 32
the really important parts look at the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
on TV it ' s like that very safe modern	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
problems with that one	56 56 56 63
yeah it probably is so be wary of anyone	64 64 64 64 72 72 72 63 63
own boss and to do your own thing and	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
didn ' t lose weight and you just keep	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
wealth and it ' s to build money	63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
into the film and television industry	64 64 63 72 72 64
description below to see something like	72 72 48 72 64 64
experience that you would get	64 56 56 64 56
me to the casting director donna	64 64 64 64 64 64
and make it look real that can be a	63 63 36 36 63 72 72 72 63
like what just happened and how long you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

will give you the tools to succeed and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
maybe I should have seen this coming	72 72 72 72 72 72 72
that you can correct right now without	63 63 72 72 72 72 72
because if your face gets seen as a	72 45 72 72 72 72 72 72
retention is now in summary there are	56 64 56 56 56 35 35
agent sent me an email says	36 72 64 64 64 72
three thousand dollars you ' ll go through	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 36
helps you understand that there are many	63 63 63 72 56 63 0
you set a salary of forty thousand	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
so it is important to find advice from	64 64 64 64 64 72 72 72

maybe they just needed someone taller	63 63 63 56 64 64
haven ' t yet start investing i really	56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64
closing deals can be very sporadic	63 56 56 56 56 63
as well even if your ultimate goal	64 63 63 63 63 63 63
project like that you know working like	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

and it also affects whether or not it	56 56 56 56 35 49 49 49

some of these smaller	64 56 56 64
the extended warranty option extended	56 63 64 56 56
so let ' s first talk about what you	63 64 64 64 64 64 64 56 56
uh it ' s something that ' s broadcast on tv	42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 63 63
filmmaking communities and see if you	63 63 63 63 56 63
full extra day you can give yourself an	63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
casting profiles like actors access or	56 56 56 56 56 56
to a new market	56 56 56 56
of pocket each and every month but	56 63 63 63 63 63 63
learning investing in our skills and a	56 63 63 63 56 63 63
are the best acting teachers in	63 63 36 56 56 36
only 2 500 per month so if you do the	63 63 63 63 63 64 63 63 63 63
but they were all wins because they	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
to give them a second round of auditions	36 36 63 63 63 63 63 63
for pig i love this week at access	72 64 72 63 63 63 64 64
taking headshots for actors a headshot	64 64 64 64 64 63
yep well and that ' s and again it it goes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
kind of follow me with the camera I ' d be	72 63 72 72 72 54 48 63 63 63 63
in the comments below that ' s it for this	64 64 64 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
desperate to	0 0
monologues in previous videos but if you	63 63 36 36 72 64 64
video in my trailer so we are finishing	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
energy in alignment with my values and	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
job what this pretty much means is you	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
aftra and the cost for joining the union	64 64 64 64 56 56 56 56
doing our face needs to be well lit for	24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24
videos just like this	63 63 25 25
huge depreciations and actually lose	56 56 56 24 24
could have made because especially when	63 63 63 63 63 63
plenty of actors that have done that and	56 56 64 72 72 72 72 72
it ' s your first time doing it	63 63 63 56 56 63 63 63
just the first letter of each word to	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
super fun and i ' m excited to share more	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
doesn ' t necessarily show us that you can	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
out from all the reading in your real	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
puts down 6 % and when you ' re looking at	63 56 63 63 64 63 63 63 63 64 64
if this is your first time here make	72 64 72 72 72 64 63 36
what you can do if you don ' t have too	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
48 dollars per year	64 64 64 64
might get the occasional client from	63 56 56 63 63 63
a link to it	32 64 64 64
so when i got started i was really just	40 40 72 64 56 72 72 72 72
you know be behind the scenes and	72 72 72 63 72 63 63
agency this is why it is so important to	45 72 63 63 36 64 56 64 64
real estate about entrepreneurship	63 63 64 63
character breakdown is more or less a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
acting is not an	63 56 56 56
can learn CSS in two days and then you	24 24 24 24 36 24 24 24 24
and it looks completely new now as for	72 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
if you played luke skywalker in star	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you whether or not a deal is good all	63 56 56 64 56 56 56 35 40
or starting a new career path so i am	42 63 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
read the books I recommend and then I	56 56 56 56 56 32 56 56
your local area or owning properties	56 56 56 56 42 42
they know how much	63 63 63 63
reminds me of one of my favorite	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
more about choosing great quality	72 72 72 72 72
for a lot of actors because we hear that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
money we must take time to dress for our	20 48 48 9 9 42 72 81 81
maybe even film a vlog	32 20 28 28 56
requires 135 hours of class time and	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
changed as well	63 63 63
someone a little bit younger and i ended	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
that i ' ve been in for about six months	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
hiring an agent you ' re not going to rely	72 64 64 64 64 64 56 56 56 56
house at 5 : 00 a . m . one day and then the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
fourth step is to	56 56 20 56
it ' s made a lot of people very rich and	25 25 25 25 25 0 0 0 0 25 25
for those to do so I think I ' m gonna	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then if they like what they see then	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
they all allow you to do the same thing	63 72 56 72 72 63 63 63 63
that ' s not how it works	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
the bank	56 56
before going in now cold reads are not	63 64 64 64 63 63 56 64
the rest of the cast remember that they	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
the final column for the film section is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
close to you the premise of the 48 hour	64 64 72 56 64 64 64 64 64
that being said how good your audition	63 64 64 64 63 72 72
too and we ' ve known each other for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sources and i ' ll speak about that later	64 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
role because and it ended up with me	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
auditions there will be no blocking	63 63 63 63 63 63
this is you taking control of your own	24 63 63 56 56 56 56 56
and that is voice acting voice actors	64 64 64 64 72 64 63
the things that i am great at so i did	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
friends our family our local community	63 63 63 63 63 63
so the way that you would put training	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to join the union nationally so you	64 64 64 64 64 56 56
weights is my overall like	0 0 0 0 0
I call it my audition cheat sheet and	64 63 64 64 64 64 64 64
you will learn how to spot deals and	56 56 56 64 64 56 56 56
maybe it says	63 63 63
union background vouchers again check	64 64 40 32 64
potentially take you out of	32 56 56 56 63
which way to turn	63 63 63 63
you guys can use to reduce your spending	63 63 63 63 63 64 64 56
so i was really excited when i found out	40 56 56 64 40 64 64 64 64
paying tax one time	20 32 32 32
then there are probably other casting	63 63 63 63 64 64
with discipline and structure and things	0 0 0 0 0 0
wedding photographer and i think it ' s a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
young actors especially they quit	63 63 63 63 63
trying to get their careers off the	63 63 63 63 63 42 42
work on student film so if there ' s a	64 56 56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
way you set a line it ' s like well let	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
we ' re at right now and even before the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
performer and whether or not they are	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
you any money	64 64 64
all over the world and there ' s no way i	64 64 64 40 40 72 72 72 72 63 63
we do that we first have to make sure	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
students for recommendations for a	64 64 56 56 64
here are the top three reasons one they	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
you go into an audition dressed in full	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
human being and learn that first	32 32 36 36 64 72
don ' t quit keep at it keep pushing	56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64 64
something that I think would personally	63 63 63 63 63 56
extremely extremely common so with a	56 56 56 56 56 63
over the step - by - step process of buying	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64 64 56
a lot of money it ' s gonna really	56 56 56 56 36 36 36 36 56
they end up paying	63 63 63 63
middle of my audition to hear the	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
higher end of that spectrum in awesome	63 56 56 56 63 63 64
remember this is just how you get	64 56 32 63 56 56 56
into the film and television industry	64 64 64 64 64 64
then also if you want to subscribe to my	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

Oh died uh I like um I like I like	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 64
career where	63 63
it ' s like this really [UNK] color	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 63
before I went to bed and then as soon as	56 56 56 56 56 63 56 56 56 63
uh black widow right there just dropped	64 64 64 30 30 25 64
as well as they do have really good	56 63 56 64 63 63 63 63
only one short scene	64 64 64 63
the science behind it or the the	56 56 63 63 36 36 56
non - union and a production can also be	64 64 64 56 56 56 64 56 56
if they ask for it you should be able to	63 63 36 36 36 45 45 45 64 25
co - founders you can go down the start	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56
more money but you ' re gonna have an	56 56 56 32 32 32 32 56 32

mentioned this multiple times during my	63 64 64 64 64 64
school directory on small market after	64 64 56 64 64 64
have many many scenes that you ' re trying	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
you ' re seeing current information so	64 64 64 64 64 64 20
show more of a contrast between those	63 63 63 63 63 63 72

well they ' re going to get [UNK] with	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 56
the key is really to not overthink it	63 63 63 63 63 56 56 63
important to get really good lighting in	63 63 63 63 63 63 63

first is you build equity right whenever	63 63 63 63 63 63 72
thumbs up and subscribe to this channel	56 63 56 56 64 64 64
my gosh you ' re asking me to	63 63 36 36 36 63 63 63
my team really consisted of myself i had	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
work your way up to larger and larger	56 56 64 56 56 56 64 64
have you have proper training you know	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
actually let me say that let me	63 36 72 64 64 72 72
or in one of the rooms and rent out the	49 49 56 32 32 56 56 49 49 56
then like i get a few pennies but if	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
when someone doubts me or even when i	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
personal brand that professional	24 72 72 36
it ' s the name of the film	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this this is basically a cheat code a	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
because it lets people experience the	0 0 0 0 0 0
i had a virtual assistant that would	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
literally just	63 63
have to make sure	63 63 63 63
so it really just depends on incide ly	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah I ' ve gotten this personal results	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that ' s it for this video if you liked it	63 63 63 63 36 32 40 40 40 64 64
be on the lookout i hear it ' s running on	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64
about that your agent had your back	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all things that are going to cost you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
phone number in which case you can just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
rapid receipt	64 0
should be paying for when you	64 64 64 64 64 64
cheaper for the production so that ' s why	64 64 64 36 63 63 63 63 63
how might this expenditure change if i	64 64 64 64 64 64 0
who are willing to work as hard as they	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
netflix youtube premium hulu disney plus	63 63 63 63 63 63
and pay attention to the other person in	45 45 45 45 72 64 64 64
so you know he ' s a huge huge celebrity	64 36 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 64
2 . 25 percent is huge so let ' s say that	64 64 64 64 63 63 56 56 56 56 56 56
your attitude if you present yourself in	56 64 63 63 63 63 63
the casting director does have an	63 45 45 36 36 36
them to do work	36 36 56 56
yeah that ' s probably the best thing	56 56 56 56 64 56 56 56
before in a previous video where we	64 64 64 64 64 64 40
to wear for my auditions so now that	63 63 63 63 63 72 72 64
so after i got released i just assumed	64 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
huge video files or streaming netflix on	56 63 56 56 49 56 63
outsource and i think that ' s so	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
this is called house hacking and i	56 56 56 56 56 56 56
research that on your own but i do know	63 72 72 63 56 56 56 56 63
your business	63 63
and i actually have a 12 off coupon for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
then tell them about it be the type of	36 36 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
purposes now you will also hear the term	56 63 63 63 36 36 36 36
anyway get in the habit of always	64 63 56 63 56 56 56
estate agents don ' t want to pay for	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
right next to and then I could squeeze	36 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
going to be stronger	63 63 64 64
straight auditions without booking a	56 56 64 72 72
browse the full price stuff but i will	56 63 63 63 56 64 56 64
guarantee you that ninety percent of the	63 63 56 56 56 56 56

is that there are certain factors that	64 64 64 64 64 64 64
you have to look out for	56 56 56 64 64 64
when i was younger so who knows what	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63

same quartz countertops these are	0 0 0 0 0
people will say that sitting down and	64 64 64 64 40 35 20

your resume this can be printed on the	36 63 36 36 63 63 63 63

maybe that ' s when they ' ll finally ask me	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
outside of that particular industry	64 64 64 64 56

have to pay all of those extra costs so	56 56 56 56 56 56 56 56 64
very complex topic	56 56 56
request and that ' s it this is the only	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but i just want to give you one example	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
such as business meals printing ink gas	40 40 0 0 0 0 0
if you like this video give it a thumbs	72 72 72 63 63 63 63 63 63
but because I ' m the closest one to him	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
that list leave me a comment down below	72 36 36 72 72 72 72 72
which means casting directors will ask	56 64 56 56 56 32
corp is that you ' re actually	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
helps to do your own research too	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
different way to ask and when you do	56 56 56 56 63 63 63 63
needed to be able to perform right away	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
prior to getting an agent in fact those	56 56 56 56 56 63 64 64
brilliant and in fact one way to justify	36 36 63 36 32 32 56 64
casting websites like backstage	56 56 56 64
your headshot is your most important	63 72 63 72 72 72
hey we ' re in my hotel room again because	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
our body naturally does and a lot of the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on it anyways with selling a house of	56 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
attention now there are all ways that	24 64 24 24 24 24 24
backtrack again to that story i just	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
magically get signed to an agent without	64 64 64 72 63 63 64
not book them which was true i did not	64 64 64 56 56 56 32 64 64
but you have to look at it as a business	64 64 56 56 56 56 64 64 64 64
the even thing about that that means	63 63 63 63 63 72 63
are not going to be any more free acting	72 63 63 36 36 36 63 63 63
change might have already happened but	63 63 63 63 63 63
000 after that it drops down to 2	56 63 56 56 63 63 56 56
