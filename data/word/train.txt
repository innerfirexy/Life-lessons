the rhythm of the conversation when

they want you to stand it's used in
yeah it probably is so be wary of anyone
we'll save that for another video my
about how
it's provided you keep showing up
next up is focusing only on the present
all i want to do is help you guys save
I got the audition it was for a police
and my heart is truly to help you do
any benefits or any of those things
i'll post below it shows you how you can
afford what they're gonna do is they're
once you're making $100 a month it's actually a lot easier
It's a bit old fashioned
research all the big markets see what
that you're willing to give up all of
is through their guidance
how to answer the question but I never
and this approach is great
and that's the first thing that they ask
and it also helped me get a first class degree
almost four years now I want to say is
that you can put into your solo 401k

anything that is related to your

and nothing good ever happens and you just wanna sleep
other costs associated with holding
doctor on that show and i'm in episode
their careers they decide they want to
have to make sure
so let's take a look at my answer right
is such a massive source of stress in
that they are today
and it was just really nice
between being union and non-union well
invest in real estate they need to buy a
"I hated every minute of training
description so if they can if if they
lose her the role that worked for her
Another example is my YouTuber friend Oliur
and we presented it there
days you might be meeting new people
however don't listen to that don't think
off because this is who they called in
bringing in any income
about how hard it is to get started
haven't seen that
with our memorization with lines you
carbs and if you're someone who loves
on his YouTube channel he talks about
this is what you really want and you
and more importantly to my mum who's watching
some of the actors that they really
the key is really to not overthink it
now this is actually a heavily debated
be very very smart so first up is being
a server side language like Python
bigger and more significant portion of

that's the big set up but I show people
just do kind of an

Whereas otherwise I'm just in kind of technician mode
like a Tesla Model 3 for the business
acting auditioning and career advice
you do have to join the union after a
asked me how old i was at the time i was
involved and audition for
and it's totally worth the price
and verified your identity
that they take a commission off of your
could completely change your whole real
video it's perfectly fine to shoot in
overall if you want to spend less money
really serious
ask yourself this do I currently own a
your belt when you go on to a bigger
if someone tells you hey can you please
to have the highest credit score you can
look at the television film and web
in terms of gaining as much experience
about my thoughts on that and when you
worry about
but also if you want to really do this
that's because agents and casting
with a monologue it can be applied to
with this kitchen a built-in stove lots
like there are some things i can talk
on my list
kind of newer in the industry or just
once I've made them other than a reply to comments
you're all the way at the bottom at a
so that is a
did in 2015 we both know how to code and
video if you liked it please give it a
receding and there's a concept that she
and she mumbled over to the groom and
something that never really crossed my
strategies if it is something where you
of actual work to keep it ticking along
characters lines beforehand you go in
can play mozart on the violin
Maybe not when you're asleep but basically every other time
like this I would start to run some
loan defaults it's a way for them to

and recovery which is why for the actors
of them like less than five percent get
poem from the early 1900's that goes as
on them completely they are your guide
ten years in my career I've done maybe
keep pushing forward now with all of
open house date so what we did was we
think 2017
thing that wasn't sustainable for me
like your drama club or school plays
turn them into a working actor but
Thank you so much for watching
out how much house you can actually
in New York City and you can do the same
they cuz sometimes just need that
and how you can do the same
maybe five thousand dollars resurface
Now you can avoid having to charge for your online courses
some point in the future
And once you've written the whole day off
directly into the camera lens the next
And again this is not good
when they hear it
This first lesson that I shared
that affect how much an individual earns on YouTube
I'm making like 50 pounds a day
and you're buying a camera for example
experience the first thing that i want
and nail an audition but it also sucks because in real life
because if you can teach something and
there's a lot of like nutrition camps
beneficial from a full nutrient
see me in one scene well guess what the
refers to how an actor physically moves
your local area or owning properties
you can use that loss to offset other
properties that are too lavish
so is it possible to live in a house or
co-star here in the
that actors can supplement their income
sell the house you're gonna get that
point which is
spread but they look more bulky four
where we do these virtual classes for
lines one last time in my head to make
you learn the skills you need to break
not gonna look good at all so make sure
unless they are super super good you
is going to be the best route to take
and then telling that to the agent
we're gonna give the starting difficulty
then I've created a free audit cheat
and that transformed the way my images
if you want to download my free audition
not you're being treated fairly if
co-founders you can go down the start-up
at that point your course needs to actually be good
because I think it's genuinely really good
they are adding valley to the house and
credits to your resume but they also can
their movies throughout the year or
anywhere near as much as a day on set
where I'm having fun
want to know all of these terms before
comes in and asks us to add this line
little bit too much for you yeah like
every week
The second way of making money from shares
say it that way and that we have to have
well now is where we get into the second
as long as it's good obviously has to be
money so by understanding the way the
want to take on that by yourself and
or an internet entrepreneur
And so question number seven is
if you didn't like it and you totally
completely profile to the camera and the
and producers and everybody else in this
license with a brokerage and this is
now they're talking to the camera to the
want to work one-on-one I always want to
then keep watching this video because
to just fire them all out like a machine gun because we don't have to think about
for let me first tell you what I've been
So that's kind of weird
So going back to our side hustle assessment matrix
and that will cost anywhere between
and he's kind of making a broader point about life
really popular alone that people can get
of deals and money you make that's when
with an fha or a conventional loan

downsides to just really make sure you

But then I started actively
each and every transaction so yeah let's
i can't do it from where i live i would
the audition and this is the part that
- Hey friends
be where i am in my career right now had
comfortable with house hacking
I think no it's a flywheel
not very concise
in exchange for having them tape your
15 20 before you elect to join that's
about about this one thing and the
and it's harder for me now to accept a
they now need to cast the movie right so
for that
you might have been thinking
gonna want something more like a 2700 K
then send it to them
they actually just spring for a
all these auditions and I didn't book a
you're ready to perform
at least once a week."
such an online brand and a lot of the
you take the exam that's way worse than
background work does not go
20 or 30 dollars in 10 years because if
that wasn't a part of the audition it
represent that fit
auditions you've got to get better at
are more credits i just don't list
and your online casting profiles like
maybe a few thousand dollars of mortgage
i knew that now that they're shooting
doing that that we are amateurs so this
with something ask yourself how hard should this really be
2008 I walked into my very first acting
it's important to go to a professional
rather than the window opener attitude
biggest reason why people fail the test
jobs and the history of work and how we
I'm making sometimes one penny per day
a handful of auditions a year
So that is a solid half hour-long introduction
for the theater side of your career
and how your audition kind of fits into
off dvd sales or blu-ray sales or video
Doe I'm 45 years old
would give me the sides then and there
step in the process
streaming services it's going to save
here in the atlanta area but if you live
3000 K because I found that was the best
not be a featured role in your auditions
like eight years to build up
if you book an acting job and you make
acting classes that you could benefit
that tipping point where you can't keep
work that can back up
and then we would put the director so
grout lines and just choose like a white
yourself to answer these questions I
than if i had bought
Thursday kind of a toss-up so let's just
have to have all of these sections when
course i'm cheering for you guys
they are not too customized or too
who has a strong resume and a body of
comment too I'd love to hear about the
is one line of a resume for the
before anybody pays you to act before
We had donuts from the hospital canteen
a three out of five-star rating for difficulty
Now apparently 48% of affiliate marketers globally
learning and i can't wait to see you on
But obviously this is not the way to look at it
world is worn with medical school with
and that is that you can offer to work
is also acting and a lot of the people
for some shares in Apple."
well if you send me a file that's named
agent sent me an email says
and I imagine around the rest of the world as well
well the big problem with that two big
because Muhammad Ali famous boxer
and so i would say that that mastermind
my acting range yeah yeah like out for a
have to know if you're good at acting if
sat in the computer room the five six of us
as a police officer it's harder for them
find the property and make sure that the
perform in front of an audience
if I want to
all right that was a step-by-step
this role but then ultimately i didn't
recovered a little bit more now I can
or fatigue or overall exhaustion that's
then growing a YouTube channel
backyard or any other common areas the
but then we can sell infinite copies of
you you know you haven't given it enough
buying it five days later i went back to
because you're thinking about investing
in exchange for discounted classes you
move to this city
don't regret that at all i
that but whenever I see the crew getting
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
And that's actually quite hard to do
unpaid or
out to tenants
they gave me two or three different days
question because the truth is an agent
but i just want to give you one example
with head shots the next thing that
in the united states you are either a
the most kind of satisfaction when you do it
And so you need sponsorship or a brand deal
create an example acting resume
to earn the money to buy the thing and
so that's why i say step nine here is
confidence that you're the right person
completely false
it's a really big time commitment and it
of making money on the internet now 13
simple but as you saw I was smiling
actual audition for a commercial
that your business bought you
going to be stronger
have to pay annual dues annual base dues
there wasn't the pressure
jumpstart their career alright until
important whether it's you know from
twelve years having agreed within your
and all these meeting lists and all these societies
becoming a professional actor requires
into in my business that truly has
now self tapes are becoming much more
you can ask your teacher or other
to productivity and fulfillment
industry standard is to only write
the S&amp;P 500 has had
lines all memorized you've made some
Now I can't be bothered
not living there you'll probably have to
unexpected repairs for example what if
huge benefit to being in these
and insecurity going into university about making friends
to get a thousand downloads per month
We're gonna give that a four out of five stars
these deals they are
the lenders only look at the credit
And that is a more accurate idea
well if it's gonna go up or not and how
all celebrate the audition itself and
And it didn't really require any like special knowledge
club series where we distill and discuss
so many kind of online courses that seem
about is where is your tipping point
But I've sort of ingrained it into my life
however the good news is that i'm
allows you to take
now this window is an 8 by 10 aspect
because you can save a lot of money the
but in in my experience that's like
time watching one of my videos
do on the internet wherever you are in
And so in a way I'm getting this 50,000 pounds car
- Okay so if you spend any amount of time on YouTube
be quite hard to find someone like that
I've worked on then I've created a free
for your exams effectively and efficiently
more money does not lead to more
the molding and the trims choose maybe a
want to do that
can and a paintbrush or any other
and all these different factors
accents and don't forget audition
pay full price for clothing i just don't
every business needs a marketing plan
right so for this particular role they
videos either directly to the casting
actually grow your business you want
awesome homes that you probably would
example in palo alto where i was raised
them and then dm them all the time about
throughout your entire body and
absolutely have to learn how to code but
so if this is something that you're
for instance
they will range between probably a

potential money that can be made
the agent now passing that information
example is the show i'm currently
your character would be wearing but you
summary for you to go over as well what
talent agent can be really helpful
more wealth these are very common habits
But again once you've stumbled on a formula that works
lot of people right
have to find that sustainability so when
crashed literally to zero i.e all top 500 companies
It's not just a few pennies here and there
Again depending on which country you're in
where you have this minimum threshold
learn the skills you need to break into
And that is where investments come in
looking for months and months without
A lot of people said like financeshially financially
if you wanna become like you know
think of your brain as a tool that can

some of the core stuff you might not

will book it well the answer to this
the next way that actors can make money
talk about uh
i make a ton of content about real

And in the future you're always gonna be so glad
You really wanna be more of a documentarian of the stuff
so the truth about productivity
original question of was was sitting
luck to get to the point where we can
talking more about spending money and
there's all sorts of different platforms
market with a ton of really valuable
twenty seven hundred dollars per month
deductions the real secret sauce with
options there are many different ways to

talking about how you can get rich quick by whatever scheme
they select who they want to see

more interesting than the way that we
actually gonna have

videos just like this
in the united states but i was in the
channel to get more videos on acting
this video or even more detailed videos
the casting directors and producers made
audition on one hand and the world's
some kind of money through this passive income stuff
the teams that are competing
it's not just about getting the agent
take a look see what you can cut out and
their income satisfies the debt to
right for me my faith is really
good-looking people do get more opportunities in this
made lightly or quickly
And so they would all start off as red
And that's a different sort of fun
And then that fund would have a fund manager
or something like that
i'm not saying to take advantage of that

she started five months ago
was a little caught off guard by it and
just really crazy to see that they can
things that you are working through and
all of these things are sacrifices that
and i didn't book any of those initial

so you may have to do your own research
body in my brain absorb all of this the
consider you for other roles in the
in individual stocks is it's kind of risky
have a lot of things automated you have
because the longterm difference between 0.1% fees

out of thousands of dollars by these
that you really want to nail down is

is by creating some call it some kind of paid membership
still getting my Netflix it yeah that's

It was like 15
that I still have to repay
before in a previous video where we
background work on your acting resume it
but you really wanna start doing things at 18
And beyond that every year you're just making 10,000 pounds
outside of the classroom never from an
majority of professional acting work
And thirdly you're not planning to gonna have
look really good another thing I did was
least two years as your primary
on my part other than a cursory knowledge of medicine
booked a role on stranger things and you
Brandon anywhere and then if you could
for star wars now i'm going to add
I really wish I'd done a little bit of work every day
about what the costs are to start an
you don't want to be a one-hit wonder
those things for quite a while and you
increase drastically and being able to
you stay top of mind it's kind of like
then buy it from a third party that's
with you a few lessons that I've learned
atlanta home studio today that's because
process the smoother it's going to go
stay safe they high decay we will
and then the results will be all the
hands-on you can get i know a lot of
why I recommend for most people with a
what i would say is if you are in this
Point number seven is I discovered
visually going to be a happening and
that bus joint has been incredible as
the audition
can contact them
then you can sign up for an imdb pro
doctors so by the same token agents sign
you're supposed to do
series of online courses aimed at
as a whole of the S&amp;P 500 you get a general idea
services and in fact you can even sell
house is probably going to be the
every audition is a win because of and
i couldn't make the second audition they
regular people because that's who the general public will identify with
well those training videos hire actors
if they interviewed a basketball player
they make their final decision they cast
typically used in the commercial world
now if i lived in california or new york
major leak in the house that's why a
actual words that are written and just
from and into because if we're not
time in your business set or it just
per business mile driven so let's say in
typically a casting director will reach
is to start a YouTube channel
if you don't know what a stand-in is
because the job is ultimately meaningless
meeting new people and needing to break the ice
those are all extra expenses for the
so if you hear about a role that you
because normally for investment
this we are almost always doing
you can also put on if you've done any
retailers that
right you want to have a
they're going to say well show me some
families by just doing commercials
you're gonna get the best rate possible
channel because
loan costs and that's gonna add up to no
your profiles on these websites are
are on the right track if you want to
I'm gonna give $100 a month difficulty a four-star rating
going to be on tv
and now he's selling it for lots of money
to save you a lot of money it's going to
i went full time
yeah I've gotten this personal results
this is basically everything that i'm
off-book they're asking you do you have
And when you get to actually being a doctor and
printer if you do check to see if it can
you can still use this
skill to have
W I L you period
anymore so that is the biggest
whenever you go into an audition by the
footage that we can use for ourselves
most money actually join a brokerage and
things the

excited to be talking about something I
That's got less of an obvious benefit
there for your clients you won't have as
account and then you can put your

just think to yourself "This is going to be fast

and this has a lot to do with
in this video
this is a follow-up video to a video i
And should spare that $10 a month

crank through it it's probably not gonna

that i have made the third investment
in the united states movies and tv shows

For me I kinda struggle with..
soft white light it wasn't too yellow
need it what's the harm and bringing it
example let's say there's a new movie
very common and this happened to me many
Like when I get home from work let's say it's 9PM

right now almost everybody has a phone
yeah he's going and then going through
requires lots of upfront effort in terms

now once you've worked on your first

of production the prop plays a very
acting career how much does it cost to

To learn how to code

And we're gonna cover this

now that I have a YouTube channel which was quite nice
their scenes cut from a movie or a

which just shows that there's nothing in particular
are community theater where you can act

We'll start by talking about the logistics

and then later that day i got an email
So if you have a one hour class on Skillshare
think about acting just like any other

a production like this and thus should
because to be honest there's only a
um typically on a monthly basis how much
material you choose we went for a quartz
platforms there are

we actually get into like the specifics
so on the day of your headshot session
know but at the end of the day it comes
use the Vanguard as well
used casting websites are actors access
this type of information is included in

I don't want to pay mortgage insurance
Let's have a look at some of my more popular videos
so i've been a working actor for almost
and it's just so much harder to to learn
able to share more
one of the most common questions I get
and if you have any questions remember
joining the sag-aftra
films and short films and
when you're watching the show I'm
if I hadn't just taken that extra step
something else

So yeah I really began to appreciate
always come back to thinking about how
actors access and casting networks
And so the conundrum that we're dealing with
to sit down and learn to code
Don't worry about working
all right i don't want to do this and
to discuss today about how
psychologically am I am I just in a
realized this when i was just getting
they'll be working with
compare that to a normal brokerage
lesson that i learned
it's usually the producers and the
that while i might not be able to
And just that kind of color coding
and say that there are many
shooting with other photographers
booked my role
but what I've realized over the last few months
that takes a lot of effort to get going
exercising for it to even be effective
the casting director is looking at a sea
can really get a great workout and
and finding a ton of free resources
isn't laugh-out-loud funny or super
because i am working so much in film and
the exact right dimensions every single
and exactly what value you're providing
acting teachers that charge
there is still a high chance
essentially sharing that credit card
people understand that there
it ends up costing my business 40,500
differences are between being non-union
important to talk to a lender they're
wanted to be super cool and therefore
consistently do about a couple hours per
but it's very hard to become a good one
see you guys in the next video
download my 10-step audition preparation
they actually invested but with all this
into your actual house-hunting because
of neighborhoods are going to do well
say fifty dollars to two hundred dollars
one day
standing up for an audition they make no
every person that ends up taking this
and all that kind of crap is that it doesn't recognize
for a brief moment let me give you an example let's say the scene that you're
all of that work is the 90 this is the
for the next year
it so that's why i recommend a scene
if you guys are donating it make sure to
anymore like are those like sentence
like three times and then here we would
is really going to add up just note that
into the templates so there was a lot of
two on my list is
are people who don't know who I am
But that meant that all of the coding
come to me with injuries and in fact I'm
up to a whopping
And I've started actively tracking this
because this is show business
you'll have an audience and you'll be able to make
congratulations you guys watch this
or to invest in the self-taping setup at
so i hope all that makes sense in terms
once you have a couple
you take something like an
more turnkey but there are some things
for and i don't think that's a great
just buy a condo or a single family
have a particularly profitable year
And there's a really long one about
forcing people to join
or a star wars movie
you know if you're spending more money
Because again you have to be able to provide value
and I always kinda thought that
to pay 24 grand for a brand new Tesla Model 3
other things one of the most important
point you are supercharging your
bachelor's and a master's degree
character is totally different than who
as a way of acting they only think about
Firstly don't worry
question you want to know what you

buy that meat for the week or go to the

leave them down in the comments below
even though you don't have an agent

a lot saved up now what I like to tell
everything onto one page of a resume it
if the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall
part of an audition is what's going on
is to use a little bit of math and crop

I need to be motivated to watch this next episode
clearer picture of what you need to do

show agents that you are serious about
that could throw them off right then and
into making these like websites and these projects
on zoom unfortunately i was not

I'd recommend starting with the basics

if someone didn't do that in real life for an extended period of time

you put in there you can look at past

to get into movies and tv shows because
if this isn't nice I don't know what is
questions because i've never lived in
yes i really want to be an actor and i'm
something athletic to your audition but
submissions from all kinds of crazy
are a real estate agent then sadly no
audition class i highly
serious about it and i'm really good and
the same thing
so they decided okay we can't consider
wasn't auditioning for film and tv so it
outsource more because you'll actually
But the point here is that
mention here that i didn't hire anyone
in Final Cut and after working through
the audition can be live and in person
that's going to be a very personal

stuff added up together that is why
your property there's a lot of prep
these five tips these are the things
if you are the type of person who

instead they're moving all their stuff
and that can draw lots of attention yeah
so here are six steps that you can take
i got as soon as i moved to a major
basically all of my investments all of my money
or running a supervision for my students
and I think oh actually this is kind of reasonable
also need to consider that it's probably
you know there's just there's so many

And so with me for example
we in the industry don't need to hear

looking for and
before they can try to get to play into
acting classes are so vital to your
groups you can start looking for
You just genuinely have to have something
is to start a podcast
takeaways that i think
schedules change all the time

I see they're super low and you have to

and they would use that audition to cast
doesn't take as much time
of my career personally i'm currently
Point number 11
to make a significant amount of money for Patreon
right out of frame so when the auditions starts
that's the cost of borrowing the money
even know what would happen yeah I just
writing in the middle of it
want so if we drag it all the way now we
much routine as possible however in the
in a savings account right now
which is a tripod for vloggers it's
all the way through to machine learning algorithms
that we see in our YouTube Studio these are so important
obviously there are a ton of actors who
because I can't handle these losses."
spending some time here with me today if
did you know that just about every major
wasn't a part of the I mean it was in
building that relationship and think
little bit but i also understood that
what i mean by this is
actually selling the watch and we
most of that stuff will not show up in
because it's gonna cause you undue
cashless and this is becoming more
person right
oh that was actually a really good day
okay but now let me talk about a couple
out it'd be at some really cheap place
your acting ability is and if you can
oh I don't know is that really enough to
thus have the best opportunity to get
and the projects that are filming in
the extended warranty option extended
really depends on the lender that you go
There's nothing sexy or exciting about it
pursue a photography business no matter
content consistently over a long period of time
value then it just doesn't make sense
this industry but similar to
fees every time that you
maybe take my shirt off to make it more
especially now where
out from all the reading in your real
So let's say I want us to take out
and you've prepared for this audition to
Thursday I have I have a job coming up
are available on Skillshare
it because we never use that function a
that mastermind opened my eyes to so
how do you get your license and then how
may put on
process that's helping me book many
again so I found doing this to be really
already which was great and once again i
tons of film competitions
to a free trial of Skillshare
people to hit that link will get 20
of these things have a one-time cost of
really cool how this works what it's
are willing to pay for that skill
Now I actually considered applying
is when you get paid so if you make a
taping commandment number nine is to
quite passionate on house hacking and i
another really great resource that you
there for free but the whole point is
to record remote podcast interviews
have had different experiences than i
extremely hard
action as soon as you can because in the
real estate brokerage from there you'll
real estate broker you can't buy or sell
So pretty easy to start
if they do their tax rate is going to be
fantastic scene for a demo reel
can do is become an authorized user

inside of this house kind of going

level 3 comes in level 3 is when we
So if that sounds up your street
everyone you just need to know what it is that you
play here or there
And so when I would make my revision timetables
Again it's one of those things where the individual event
is also used by the agent when they are
just anything that shows your income is
especially if you can find the right
and you have booked the room because if
throwing money away buying these
I wanna be doing for the next weeks or the next month
that up to you
they can trust
put under twenty percent down for a
Right so how hard is it to start a podcast
The process of making the account
atlanta right so like i said this is a
we're not going to stick to it word for
uh it's something that's broadcast on tv
for like nine months at this point
i know you're one of the few that do
and yeah the way that they ask things
drive to starbucks and you can make
what do you do well you should create it
It's actually quite hard to get 8,000 visits per month
know there's no way to go back in time
recognize that up until 2:00 AM those Hangouts are useful
switching from your name is worn so many
exact scenario happened to me in 2017
audition in late if you turn your
the industry who makes decisions who can
show them don't tell them that you're
anymore sister to sleep with hands with
partial list if you look over at my
marketing around here especially
or whatever it was
I should be 2 pounds less and it's like
people viewing maybe 10 homes 20 homes
works for a movie
available upon
at the callback who was wearing a
headshot of you
they all allow you to do the same thing
included on different pages that her

and now the only light that's on is the

then i just don't know how useful

happened to movie stars
can't bring to the table
virtual and email has been very
help you see success much faster the
most of the stuff that you're gonna buy
it doesn't make any sense to me to learn
online level one make money online by
one of those actors in that small
Point number 19
now step number six is to create your
difficult when you have an irregular
so understand that those are some costs
headshots are the actors business card
doesn't necessarily work like that and
to see if it's going to be a good
1.5 in Berkshire Hathaway and so on
the stock market goes up
investments that i have made into my
here in california it takes about
and being a personal assistant and admin
headshot is as professional as possible
work for you and them if they don't work
listed here i've done more movies than
concerned about those things
on if I'm always going to the gym and
So overall how hard is it really
than portraiture which is what I
a list of projects that we're working on
happens all the time as well and it's
the pursuit of an
final step step number six beware of
opening up my own brokerage now while
so that the income that you generate
and people were so happy to talk to me
the audition room
when you are starting out i've asked my
to see you on set
and then they go green
so you can see how much money I really make
leave it all up to chance we said before

eventually get offered a completely

you can expect 20% of them i.e 12,500 views on each video
continuing with the star wars example
start a particular business or a website or even
of your skills by doing a play on stage
get dimmers from most of them it's a

it shows that you are working hard
charge you any money up front
vegan leather kind of desk accessories and bags

those on your casting websites in
of my investment portfolio is entirely shares
entire audition script I find that this
had long hair okay
put it in perspective of other jobs if i
you know who follow my channel
lot more strength workouts and so I need
atlanta which doesn't quite
how does this work let's talk about that
real estate is that it can be very
means you would've made $100 a month
through this about five or ten times
it is pretty scary not having money in
director in three years because of it I
two other actors using it to memorize
the day
and let's break down why
unlimited amounts of money then move
would have happened had i started at a
risk sometimes to invest if you know the
it you can combine tripods like these
should I dress for the character she
day are simply the pages of the script
like you might hire the same family
wedding photographer and i think it's a
our life energy on this thing that we
the bedroom should not be the focus of
learning and i hope to see you on set
number one is to follow the audition
or you did an in-person course they
if uh the production makes more money
really succeed you want to spend money
your career in fact I want to give you
a point where you are the spokesperson
number two another reason why every
relatively new to acting I was going on
you will find that people are just generally nice

If I'm starting something new then I know it's gonna

we have to make as actors you got to be

saved up
many things that i just literally had no
your audition
under any circumstances try and sell it
sure to leave a like and also subscribe

starting mark and we're gonna start that
can immediately get into a major
much as possible so having workflows for
those public casting calls represent
agree with more if you like this video
presentation matters your marketing
check out those like little tiki hut BBQ
right from the get-go because they think
let's say you want to put down 10% using
or a quote or literally anything I'm thinking of
you might have swing dance experience or
ideally we want the ongoing time
which is different to Canada and Germany and so on
film and then after that i got to work
i mean think about this imagine if a
has an amazing YouTube channel
schedules around that's why I recently
makes sense but
online you could very easily sign up to
even within the way of the sword coast
incomes reached into the 60s 70s and
of it I just want to ask you about how
agent this
but over the next few years my residual
Like I wouldn't get out a book and read it
using tape that's either in a form of an

so when an employee gets hired by a

Again I've got a story for med school about this
download that for free you can go by
doesn't cost quite as much as new york
the acting career center here to help
i mean like a real job you can't just
of people that receive an audition then
second thing that i've invested a lot
taxed as a sole proprietorship however
doing is that you're slowly
would come down to the performers that
you can just be like
it it totally would make sense if that
eating I like to call them lifestyles
advice now before we get started today i
sounds good you should head over to
and you know we
But if that number was gonna be $500 a month
expenses are every year
association if
need at least one or the
of when they think real estate agent
highlights from some of my favorite
hope to see you on set one day
for most people i'm talking like at
is that there are certain factors that
annual fee for actors access
other things in the acting career now
stable and it's not just the one time
my team really consisted of myself i had
and i drove
product thing it's something I'm kind of
so yeah if you're thinking about getting
anything for two days and on the third
doubt myself because i know my
the audition the focus should be on the
get a great workout in 10 minutes you
here's a way that actors can make money
are the professionals that you should
gonna work perfectly no one has to know
of the camera
exactly what i did
stopped working Wilson
you're totally cool right you turn this
to join the union nationally so you
never want to feel like there's an
other so just pick whichever one you
a for savings account
funny story to tell
those negotiations the repairs
and the third thing is you have to sign
habits that you should be letting go of
when you're first starting out when you
own boss and to do your own thing and
throughout your university years
turnkey properties third is you must
ways you can learn how to code online
finish college and go full time once i
renovations are useful make sure that
and i'll post a link to that video down
the point is that those first few
smart passive income and they've got a
super annoyed but that is just the whole
actors first and they find who they're
now you don't have to give yourself a
photo paper options as well
investing heavily in this year anyways
there are opportunities to learn there
down payment then I really like urge you
main topic is
is this book self-management for actors
started first one
a a person that works at a coffee shop
an a-list celebrity they can hire you
down for four seconds you'll see what
when you decide to join the union that's
whole piece of paper that'd be a pretty
work their way up
Bye bye
until next time break legs and I hope to
offload them from your brain and into this inbox
you have the dining space the dining
tried to make acting and everything you
we prefer brand names just mostly
probably can't see anything but I'll run
multiple projects
we might be in a show a run of a show on

right from the beginning but it should

same thing with acting the first step is
include film and tv i highly encourage
And so if you put your thousand pounds under your mattress
to a happy meaningful and fulfilled life
or hit television show that's kind of
the smartest because generally if you
and throw up this cute photo on
divided by your pre-tax
who's already dedicated to their career
so lucky to have the internet and one
sometimes for business purposes then
don't have the money to get into acting
for medical applicants applying to medical school
the perfect job if you like helping
labor union here in the united states
the CPM is around three to $7 per thousand views
it could basically have been an entire online course
an audition you have control over all
work and money and how it kind of fits
I think there is a second approach
where we can just quit our jobs and follow our passion
is that there's no upfront mortgage
down and that's why it's so popular
need to be spending some money elsewhere
okay I'm ready I can't find Brandon

why do you need an agent then if you're
in my life kind of sitting with the books
selling goods services and attention
this will show them your acting ability
It's definitely not pure hedonism
short films web series plays community
not making the YouTube video and not doing the work
because you've already built that goodwill with them
that actually I'm investing for the long term here
When I'm at work I try and go first
In fact I even have a post-it note
Whereas if I think ooh
i think it makes them
Like let's say I'm driving in the car
you need to be prepared for the
how you're getting started as an actor
but it is still only one piece of the
I ever uploaded and to this day it's
want to understand the financials of
than just
either we want to make sure our set is
i'm on the road right now i'm actually
supermodel good looks but has a mediocre audition
actor records their audition at home and
what to wear to an audition if you have
cold calling other days you'll be
put a link to that resource list
3 times as much money from the internet
have acting and auditioning experience
and competing with other people
reasonable salary and the rest of it
i still use some of these methods myself
So thank you Brilliant for sponsoring this video
have like zillions of laws they have to comply with
and that paper even ended up getting presented
atlanta isn't right for you
you've given my father
don't even have to have a fancy camera
least 95
and i hope to see you on set one day
to be able to put in
key bolded words and then spending the
audition for it and
right so this is totally fine i'm gonna
to put onto your resume and you're going
and how to live a more productive life
And so I wanna share five or so techniques
when they look at something like this
non-union project or the performer is
ever should but a lot of actors
income tax so the cool thing about an s
can actually take a lot of tax
want to do in order to gain the most
and listening to an audio book or listening to a podcast
off of the money that you make through
a bit too much and especially too early
single one maybe I'm not good enough
help me with serving my clients really
times and then just
scenes when i say you i mean all of us
the bank
let's say for example that they want to
afternoon or whatever so right how can
younger new realtors out there
the sooner it becomes a habit
at the acting studio
prepared for it and you understand that
you have something called your thirty
in one of them so this is you and you're
platform for interactive courses on
people in a way that's different
it's really going to help you to see
And the fund manager decides which companies
would have been thinking about these are
something like that but
but he was

was you know a lot easier to get through

probably get
as a few weeks but what i recommend
imagine the person that you're talking
and you'll have no problem on the test
and you put it on Skillshare
unshakable it comes from something that

say that the things that we value our

I'll talk about that in a different video
actors union we'll go over questions
so please do as much research as you can
how do we find the things that are meaningful to us
and in my entire 13-year career i have
first time on camera and get in front of
like this has been really really
so one important thing to note is that
but I wanna plug my own class
headshots done and not to settle for the
to thank Tyler one more time for joining

when you invest more that means more of

how to start a successful side hustle
about two or three days later um
you guys found this video helpful
and that's why it's just important to go
receipts super fast it's unbelievable
we really loved your previous auditions
actors make all kinds of mistakes when
acting career i'm super happy that that
it would be a good idea to wear
they're gonna tear down the walls and
renting the other ones out or you're
once it finishes loading it gives you
into being full-time
highly recommend it because when you

is a specific spot on the floor that

under a sag-aftra union contract and
description I passed on my first try and
just a little peek behind the things
and throughout these stages we
i would also recommend putting it on
who are so successful that don't do that
whatever city that they're making the
way down i'm not like in my 70s or 80s i
they're just going to move on they're

another thing that you can do to avoid staring at your partner the entire time
your circle is going to hear from their
this I'll provide some links to some
way you set a line it's like well let's
And in this context the way that we provide value
doesn't tell me anything that doesn't
on the systems and make everything work really well
telling you in this video of creating
student films
is one of the reasons why having your own business
don't have to recover as long so then
looking for that when they're deciding
instead of getting a degree in acting
elsewhere just know that it affects how
necessarily mean small city
and how to join and when to join that
over on Skillshare like of course on how
working on right now
got and that's and even when you know
like the ceo of a company
take notes and at the end of each
higher end of that spectrum in awesome
spend your time studying for the test
that you just mentioned I mean the whole
she's tiny any time we'd go to Kennesaw
slow and steady and then all of a sudden
can just kind of browse through all the
and now a little bit more keen to inflate
And that brings us on to question number three
with that being said i encourage you
and also
I would literally have had a stroke
"because well they're boring."
taped auditions look and sound amazing
lead or a supporting character
as a foundation for the rest of your life
that's how it all works now depending on

careful with their money
is something that puts money in your pocket
breadwinner if that makes sense
of it as having any value and rather
a lot of people gather them in the same
would recommend putting it on your actor
amenities B backyard just make sure that
If you liked this whole lifelong learning thing like I do
especially when you're younger just
quiet set earlier we talked about not
There's loads more to say about investing in finance
and then i drove two hours back home to
then there are going to be some
roughly very broadly speaking
guys about email list building and like
This is what I do I think it works great
that my subconscious is thinking about
that can get me onto a team that sounds
of podcasts in the world that get on average
an audition
enough so that you don't need to rely on
actress at the moment
learn how to do it well you're gonna
hire a real estate agent in the area
right financing
it or not
charge you one month's rent and then
acting Career Center website alright
steady increase in abilities you know
all you need to do is sign up to a stockbroker
energy we're exchanging for this ipad or
warranties is if something
payment of 10% and in terms of the LTV
there is to know about the business side
brilliant is by asking ourselves three
you do not need to cold call to generate
character or a series regular
consistently and provide value because
with them and then invest online
had been working together for so long
opportunities in your area
that in the film and television world a
monthly housing payment the housing
go full time so
actors and then they extend auditions to
popular back in the day and now the
these practice exams where they have
your business and be super excited about
And it kind of drives this wheel that
casting director but i'm kind of using
weddings on my own yet i was second
that you have what it takes to become an
this stuff all of this is within your
a similar commercial
fico score is made up of payment history
because that pays for a takeaway every single day
and I'm sure his stance on this is actually more nuanced
available now for example
are incredible they have a great you
to this channel to get more videos on
every time that commercial plays meaning
auditions whether that's a casting
these are examples of industrial videos
instead of needing you here in atlanta
whether you get cut or not
your drink for you
look i asked my agent this question
if they ask for it you should be able to
in that the more videos a YouTuber creates
meaning they make a 10 to 20 commission
and fifty dollars and that can get
or trainings all these things can be tax
doctor gives you their business card and
that doesn't mean that it doesn't come
three thousand dollars you'll go through
I keep preaching about it but it really
were very resilient people and our body
and I'd be like oh that idea for a video
understanding that we're not starting
on that so fifteen thousand dollars
websites out there so Redfin Zillow
watching your audition whether that's
traditional you're paying taxes later on
all the content by the way if you guys
Secondly we have a quote from Kurt Vonnegut
actor all right so way number one is
drive-through and grab the wrap of mocha
investors will pool their money
about the patient's part of it right and
information and have it stick in your
okay what am I gonna do to fill that
allowed me to grow so much is my team of
when you look at the science of it you
3% over asking price so I just wanted to
and especially if you're brand new
cost a little bit more
or digital goods then your ability to
people are gonna like it and you won't
you can really see why it's so critical
one week before your actual exam start
online educator what are the things that
and money investment that i have made
reference the the patient's chart and
going to that link right there alright
most major cities have talent agents now
what even without knowing your exact
keep practicing keep
that are like short-term painful for long-term gain
auditions and
and save on the right things as well we
actor who wants to break into the film
number three is to make sure your video
That means I have to pay 13,162 pounds
recommend you take a voiceover class if
stop worrying about your looks and start focusing
much money to do so okay second on my
a good actor
if I buy the Tesla Model 3 for 50,000
that life energy is generally worth it
and go to that event that maybe you've been putting off
being said
there was one take that I remember where
And so now I'm going from making absolutely nothing per day
film and in the scene is a husband and a
filmmaking so for example let's say you
state currently
another way that actors can make money
acting world
one year you drive 10
see success a lot quicker the next thing
was i lived way too far away
The second approach is actually instead of
this is split between three separate
information as i can
I've learned since about why that
So adding an extra 2000 pounds
you want to spend
about fifteen percent
is in commercials a lot of actors make a
we then move beyond niceties to luxuries
other people to cast us in a project
475 000 and putting 25k
that sort of money
actors to learn those concepts through
costume for an audition and I first
out there a ton of real estate agents
not then
by just filming with your phone and uploading it
important thing to understand
adding a couple lines uh they added a
that lived
without a having a large amount of money to start with
they make acting look so easy and
ellie sattler hey if you're getting
But you wanna start doing things at 18
a city nearby
method to avoid
you look at it over a whole year that's
and then just cancel out the other
reason why i say up to three thousand
background work or being an extra now
it just isn't and and i understand if
on my list
hard feelings and this at the very end
gonna range from twenty seven hundred K
in here to achieve financial
you've been taking all these steps
outside of that particular industry
So yeah last 28 days 11,618 pounds
encourage you to think about when you're
what's listed here but i don't squeeze
some common spaces like the driveway the
the best advice that i can give
But again if we assume a very very rough average
know where to find them
have nothing left to pay yourself
and as soon as i posted that video last
advanced Python courses are really good
however your net rental income after
to teach you how to add that credit
so if you are a non-union actor you are
that you could make where you're selling a good
they were brand new
videos just like this
then the employees would be more motivated
before you make a final decision of
that you could provide value if you wanted to

if you did make sure to hit that like

audition videos should be horizontal
there is a potential that you could get
an amateur and again
which takes it down to 40,500
tell me about your dog well guess what
for over and over again
look in that direction for the explosion
comments below what your approach is to
is taking that shot of tequila right now
book down in this description as well
you rely on your income so much um i
I'm gonna be making from this video
you have an opportunity to take an
introduction to Python course over it
television production hub
imposter syndrome
Python and
audition we're kind of trying to show
real estate investing whether that's
may not book future roles and sometimes
mistakes because you've made them before
And so that means that every year stuff costs about 2% more
experience than me
lot of us really struggle with this
for people that do voice acting but
audition all right if you like this
of hundreds of head shots
from about
drama club may have school plays
everything it takes to succeed agents
his work and 10 other people i in
the curtain of how this whole casting
learning every time i'm on set right so
will regret making the decision to invest
your friends as you were having chills in your room

the best case scenario is when you have
think about when you're considering
studying with music working with music
someone lived in another country and
your investment will be worth it in the
important to the beginning of every
get you an audition or wants to book you
And so in terms of maintenance of the podcast
video where i talked about black widow i
to equal the average view count for each video
on your down payment there are a ton of
really lets you get into a home with not
screenshot from the actual show
off of
the fun part begins when you start
And actually the best way to learn Python
yeah but until then you know you gotta
and most of that time was spent just
actor who they wanted for the sheriff
actors and it was distributed by 20th
So now I've got a whole list of projects that I'm working
so that you understand exactly how
that and I think a lot of
and in those instances they will post
photography business and growing a
audition for donna belijak in her office
you've possibly wondered at some point
generally speaking to invest in individual stocks
told a story as actors we are
know that you're
Because for example if we look at Apple stock price
and the southeast so in this market
secondly people in the internet I got
Naked cakes with history of dying friend
agent and you have some commercial
you would use again the same three
you'll probably move on to bigger and
october 9th and then i self-taped my
blockbuster movies and they're not major
through a commission
so let's say you were in a couple shows
i'm really good at it and what am i
in my emails or on my blog and things
there is absolutely no excuse to turn an
That means this is a roundabout of $15,000 per week
easier to clean you need

you need 28 students to take that class every month
the sooner you start investing
homes for them to see so yeah right when
or the top 100 companies in the UK
And so I think the problem
agency ask your teacher or other
you have control over that and that can
earn over three times as much revenue
something with your phone film a scene
over a very long period of time
you'll know how to run numbers that tell
money and time on your self-improvement
You absolutely can
enough money to put down 20% it's either
brother so I have to know like it
multiple marks on the ground they might
sheet that you can get from the acting
attractiveness does come into play as
making a living activity with more life
this journey certainly won't be easy in
people in the mastermind i was learning
auditions from home well let me share
renovate it and then live in it for at
if they should go to college and major
have a beginning mark and an end mark
cities they're doing this because they
do plumbing we say
if you're willing to do all of that for
making it at home you actually have to
like you may not fit the description of
post those auditions publicly why do
and everything because I just wanted a
places right so oh I'm sorry no go ahead
preference I've never heard of casting

self taping has become an absolutely
mention is that some of the some of
There is no YouTube AdSense for podcasts

You won't see any problems when you're 18

give an audition to that actor because
record a self tape as a demo reel do it
they were kind of joking and laughing
to gain experience you're going to get a
we also want to make sure they can see
there's nothing wrong with playing that game
When you have that thought process
classes or
well here's what happened after the
just buying a property and leasing it
we're working on and getting feedback
promise you'll start on your path to you
rent it out to people all that kind of stuff
something that I've worked on to try to

You're gonna join all these clubs
topics we covered
how extravagant your life is or not
challenging and shows you will never be

as you start to do web series or student

and there your little corner yesterday gabriel pixie
And so let's talk about

I mean my positioning is almost exactly
you learn the skills you need to break

same quartz countertops these are
investing out of state
if you're investing in individual stock
especially at the start of your career
that you are committed the first way to
interacting with another human being
um and you're at that tipping point
doing more stuff you'll be doing maybe a
furnace room blare up because that takes
is zero percent
so i didn't really have the financial
any questions alright until next time
is the only time on an acting resume
finding some type of exam preparation
of keeping it so for example this
that a lot of the questions on the

digital products really are the way to
casting directors
the right person for the part
for instance bfa musical theater you put
you're staying top of mind for
documented as well this means you'll
implement that content you know seeing
estate course and pass the final exam
number six is to make sure the actor is
able to make your payments and for them
per month and yeah that's a very easy
tell them you're uncomfortable with
really valuable resources and I can send
to discover their content the more they're likely
Oh and one more thing
And so the general tip here is that like think about
so that they all came through here and

in about 90 days and it's for sure the
important to go into this field with the
charging more and more especially as you

so the point is this uncapped income is
how every audition is a win right and i

in hollywood are all union members
industry so they know that if there's an
this state
sense and I know that it's it's been
for you to you know to see what are the
however if you're getting started you
a very small percentage of actors who
you're not busy at all and it was like
of money from affiliate marketing or you
up and don't forget to subscribe if you
what happens to my money over time by default
And the idea is that when you buy a share
you will pass on the first try the
that many people don't think about
if you don't have this stuff it's going
down below but yeah like i was saying a
self-taping in recent years so
not going to take you seriously
wrong choices this yeah Numa works and
potentially get a submission of
into stocks and shares
and making good videos is how you grow on YouTube
at that point i hadn't photographed any
you know the thing about that is it is
those things we talk a lot about like
oh I don't know what to write
And there is a huge difference
happening in this scene you also get an
the reason they asked this question is
money acting
the toilets and also the flooring these
for a brand that's pretty much being a

How I got started creating my businesses from scratch
So if you wanna write something off as a business expense
buying a house here in the United States
but then the market basically
you know what we don't think you're
don't you just do more theater now
the general public so
check out what the opportunities are in
set and networking opportunities and all
office deduction most self-employed
you guys need to know is how to increase
gonna start to warp and after a few
that we should even be thinking about
Well it's not really passive income
other platforms as well other websites
created a web series called
Jordan Brown who's a casting director
not show fun or show play the
usually the best way of doing that
height i think it's fine because in the

the final step of not needing anything

you can choose to do a roth or a

producers future cinematographers
before I started making any money from YouTube AdSense
well the short answer here is there are
is it television is it commercials or
stop thinking about yourself
was going to be a part of this
because it interferes with some aspects of like
the appreciation on
times more realistic
people they just wait too long until
but you can just go for something that's
take my word for it i actually just saw
comes in the form of the sacrifices that
exist well there are certain projects

You're gonna go to all these events
same way
is imdb
be talking about today let's get started
which is a fund that automatically invests
fake and what you can do to avoid making that mistake so that your audition stands
amongst whoever owns shares in Apple
they might make a mental note and the
of k so this is your profit now normally
that it ends up making the audition look fake
desperate to
main character who was played by maggie
am worthy that i have a special talents
I'm also utilizing what I have and not
things that we just talked about and
and Sharon B Ali the casting director
commandments self taping commandment

you would get 1% of that dividend that they've issued
body and use it to its full potential so
locked in a pitch-black closet don't
i've done tons of 48 hour films you can
link to it down in the description below
and what i recommend doing is paying
money for yourself tapes is to find a
six kind of go together five is to run
doctor to walk in and then
but if you need to buy a house next year
know with with those clients that train
You should invest in index funds
this little crop window what we do now

never once have they asked me to do a
clients know that I'm in the TV film
and that's what happened with my first
income in your business
and check out if they do something in

going to be talking about
from generous retailers for example
Because it's not as fun as playing squash
So I know my money's losing value
and work on both sides now if you are
joining me today if you haven't already
how do you know what to put on your
investing is through rental income and
courses or you have just finished them
your job as a standardized patient
needed to be able to perform right away

you see the outcome on the other side
what I mean is that its money
competitive this industry is
acting auditioning and career advice
now not every city uses casting networks
own personal website and if you want to

agents actually don't charge you any
actors are storytellers whether you're

and that's it must look like you
saying things like oh you guys you guys
off of commission

doesn't take too much education and it
The next question is usually when should you get started
back in 2015 I published a video titled
And this would be a very bad thing to do
went smoothly even though they had so
The sorts of companies that are advertising in those videos
feels like it has a purpose

actors can make money in the industry is
where someone that lived in another
It's a fundamental and the rewards don't come immediately
on that note I also want to mention that there is such a thing
stated if you're buying a house that's
to explain is what i mean by
people are scared to invest and get it

role in whether or not you get cast but

encourage you to watch this
that you don't have to accept everything
union wages they have to follow all of
audition right that's gonna make
well put together book that when i read
built this gas fireplace right here so
house the other thing that you will talk
their new paint brushes so in this type
worry about that don't worry about
and secondly we need to find people who

what's up my fellow actors welcome to
you walk into the sort of like family
oh this is a list of 15 things
change to sit on a chair I am carrying
also argue that body language is a huge
percentage that gets signed and gets
anymore then that's where i would say
but before we explore how you can start
at the drop of a hat this is a very
know most of our guests won't even go to
strong opinions on whether or not actors
bucks and i'm going to be on tv this is
in a project
of these websites down in the
a percentage of your housing costs or
to have surgery look even if you're
what time period you're looking at
and not focus so much on the destination
yeah just don't be afraid to buy
non-union now let's talk about how to
wear the full Jersey with the hat and
or let me text you a link and then they
invested in the bay area early or even
on your iphone from youtube best way to
the right location matters
much cash to work with is you can just
one is gonna be more healthy and more
not only are you learning how to act
now there's one more cost that i do want
value can i give out to the internet
you can write off on your own taxes
you can represent yourself as the buyer
income taxes don't pay them directly
you wear how much should you dress like
I can just treat it as a game and have fun along the way
are really not very good
of course so with it being so easy to
the time and find the ways to fit health
get a tax deduction as i could
And then during your free trial
you much more consideration because
all the roles and in this case they did
And then the year after it will be 121
president dies huh
providing value for free across the
you can have an llc with an escort
best for you and if that means to put on
asked this question in an audition and I
I've got a little sleeve on it case thing
book because that's the ratio that free
it because at the time
thumbs up and if you haven't already
agrees with me on this front
throughout the process that I wanted to
playing in the nba
Well firstly to be eligible for monetization
And it's that subtle encouragement for me
all this stuff that people messaged me about
copy beforehand so let's say you go to
more comfortable you're gonna be and the
now i'm not saying to
your expenses are going to be different
if you are gonna play that game and you know
times that
on camera with the lights and everything
and if you're interested in learning
to go full time in your small business
on some kind of membership platform like Patreon
would make a pretty cool addition to
and my weekly reviews or whatever
anything there's no like actual reason
mistake of constantly staring at your partner for the entire audition
agencies are looking for actors with
if you've already started taking acting
lot of people might be
it needs to have your stats and some way
down and transcribe this whole this
much at all in getting through a real
here you would write your character this
you again so many opportunities for
but for now take my word for it that over the long term
there's also productivity apps
stress can also have adverse effects
incredible to see just how much your
my free 10 step audition preparation
to this channel to get more videos on
a sag-aftra member or you are non-union
and when i worked on that show sean penn
so it is important to find advice from
it's not a quantitative difference
more complete way than what it's used to
eye level you don't want your camera
know like reading every word
can leverage to make money online and in
and once your channel is growing
can learn CSS in two days and then you
And if you gamified you workplace
And that means that I can just kind of write
as a doctor in the NHS the UK's National
as actors and that they are trying to
but no it happened to me and that's the
is about the question what is enough in
I've seen plenty of actors do that I do
los angeles or new york
thing that i would tell you to have is
to jump to this step
fact the audience doesn't even need to
positive return on your investment let's
showing homes to a buyer you could be
another chances are
works all of this can help you
together with your friends and filming
bedroom while debating whether or not to
started taking acting classes
put down under 20% the first one is the
the thing that we're trying to sell them
courses whatever the problem is we still
without going broke okay step one is
each other so you know awesome alright I
software basically anything you can
on set one day
personal deadline of Thursday at noon
gonna happen and so it was one of those
movies and tv shows this is the way to
and this again happens for a lot of
because it's now made me more happier
If you have more than 4,000 pounds a year to invest
along with your audition so the name of
i made those investments did i make them
sort of life lessons life advice sort of stuff
your demo reel
chase your dreams
irregular schedules and sometimes we had
seconds your knees start shaking your
their recommendations for each role of
available online where yeah you can
instead of a monologue i've talked about
here but this raises and people look at
guide that i call my audition cheat
that you've done those things and you
because it's not it's not necessarily
anyway get in the habit of always
gotten auditions for
projects and say ah I'll do it for ten
because your real estate agent is gonna
one of those days i can't remember which
expenses is 30 000
"out of this thing."
your personal tax return or i've heard
can make money online and that is by
about how to get started and how to gain
and yeah i want you guys to know that
other things that you can be doing for
might get overwhelmed by what was going
I'm married and I live in Omaha
casting director
and offer to be their reader every time
up booking the role i've also auditioned
first name last name - headshot jpg that
instagram and get a bunch of praise for
purely for entertainment purposes only
because you know there
does not have enough time to audition
looking into myself when it comes to
to talk about was specifically for
And here the answer is pretty simple
just the rule you can't work as a sales
like this entire backyard was just grass
couple more lines right here by just
the sacrifices are not going to be worth
into the trap of
and if they see that you've been doing
mentioned and then you look at okay so
to join the union
And then you would own shares in Apple
is to provide value in a way
then there's only so much hacking that you can do
and these are the tips tricks and study
he's this former Navy SEAL or is it more
and now you have someone else that can
probably have a better shot than some of
found this video
so so yeah start young and set yourself
you live it may cost a little bit less
there is
so let's first talk about what you
the productions are happening my
experience so that we can
so why 20% why is that the magic number
better the triplex has twice as many
back to the casting director and say hey
download it for free
to acting opportunities I was extremely
being cast in that type of role so when
you are momentarily distracted as you look over briefly
important to hear those different
why it's 20% they were just like hey 20%
down below self taping commandment
for is a 740 or above
and you'll find that once you get
and give it a like alright moving on the
finite number of ways that they can ask
people however when you learn about how
i'm still working on that project that i
is one option a second option for acting
entrepreneurship thank you so much for
they wanted
show you an easier way a much easier way
just like with headshots don't rush to
into the film and television industry my
carpets are a pain in the ass to clean
now before we get into what happened
can get the lowest rate possible it's
relaxed on set and be able to get into
ideal product category then is digital
you have to make sure to pay that off
you can add to your skill section
now if you run that through your sole
but it's one of the most important parts
taking photos of stuff
all have to find the the path and the
20 percent on non-union jobs
house you can depreciate 50 000 in the
that's a reason why you should always
five years ago when I first started investing
are on their short list you are in high
and then I'll go do whatever I need to
and way shape or phone so long i'm your
created on the acting Career Center
that's happening within our eyes we want
was a role that I was up for that I
the industry so make sure you find
who are brand new if this is your first
standout the first thing that you can do is to take some time to think about what
good-looking for other parts yeah that
your kitchen every dollar you spend it's
I'm gonna give this a four out of five stars
If you're in school if you've got exams to prepare for
that are in your market seek advice from
make sense okay moving on
what's up my fellow actors kurt you here
stand-in work on a project and also
travel to
every audition is yes it is an audition
is around nine thousand dollars so
we wrote on the paper it got published
really just a lot that you can do with
you can do to make the feeling of being
there may come a time where if you
overall stimulus of you know a real body
and with a triplex you have two rentable
your credit score is really high you'll
people's products is with affiliate
made a final decision yet
didn't have to spend many many years
acting auditioning and career advice
on an inexperienced actor might say oh
thing that i would have in place before
goes for all future tenants too this
literally just
and if you're in a small town where
training who know what they're doing so
are constantly networking with casting
whenever people say that i live in a
tone though I mean if I do a good enough
investment is not the same as interest
commercial world and in the film and
in real estate if you one get a mentor
be something that you should think about
most popular programming language and
and i don't want to be giving out false
cost and your savings will increase
booked for the commercial now once i was
from that link right up there i call it
that you can find on your own
both of those are union states where
whereas others you know I mean vegan
brain but studying for the test I go
my resume directly on the back the
There's always more that you could be doing
and what your circumstances are and what your job is
of these major markets
so on
asking me do i need a talent agent to
what steps do you need to take well
monologues when i think they should be
commercials on the other hand are 30
in pure profit
being the only person living on your
financial education
mistakes like printing our headshots on
is not focusing on tracking your deals
I wouldn't say it's easy to make $100 a month
I could lose all of it
or for your state so once you join these
other people but they may not have had
want to do for companies to create a
can this person afford to make these
video then i assume that you have
and you want to spend time building up
getting an agent is much more like
online course for example on how to
isn't just a memorization contest right
descriptions about these three ways
in capital gains so right off the bat
nights when he kissed you audition free
new york so yeah those are just averages
opened the door for new opportunities
in which we can apply this principle
which is generally between 2.5 and 3%
want to watch me anywhere other than
it's basically gonna be worth 50 in 10
but understand that theater acting
until next time keep practicing keep
supporting character scenes so here's
another way that an agent can help you
it and i thought ah i lost my
four bedrooms i would rent out to
start an acting career
these are the essential things that you
that's another important part about the
or buy your app or buy your website themes
that you're being paid the value of the thing
various streams of passive income to get
or principle
amateur agents and casting directors are
you know financially you can't go full
that you don't have a lot of room to
definitely you know
has this famous quote where he said something like
And then I take that 40,500 out as a dividend
my business and things i'm working on
in hand with eye lines cheating that the
agent in the us maybe there is someone
duffer brothers
and you have no acting experience this
my number of opportunities are going to shrink dramatically
is about 50% my biggest tip for studying
project the writer the director the
but i never got to meet him he was on
8x10 photo paper
then also if you want to subscribe to my
you really wanna be taking a lots more photos
which was still pretty good
i say just get started you guys get that
director asks you to slate your height
like I can want all the best things for
expensive to live in uh the other reason
in it's gonna be so exciting
so much effort to get started initially
and to make sure that the sets that they
one spot and do the scene that way but
career advice
leave them down in the comments below
painting the place you might as well
yeah that's probably the best thing
intense all the time sometimes just kind
over the last like two years of being on Skillshare
i was ready to open up my own credit
it out gone are the days when you have
good chunk of money number two is to
spending what you're able to afford
like 100 bucks normally but they have
project hopefully you've got some
expensive well that's
few credits
bones more than I have so not gonna work
an escort now when you're doing work as
um then pretty soon in the future that's
more money with increased levels of
can you stand out from the crowd
for Friday at noon I give myself a
and you chip away at what doesn't work
hundreds of homes before they actually
So pretty much anytime I come across any
i've talked about this before how
offers you representation before anybody
a link to it down in the description
To get started we're gonna give this
actor while they're trying to get all
into managing the assets as well
we're gonna give maintenance
background work does not go on an acting
which takes it down to 24,877
sales and letting your people know about
criminal negligence if she starts trying
there's so much to learn and this is a
qualified to be doing this
that's very difficult i know of
forward because just because you didn't
people will buy your paid stuff but only
get an offer accepted and
and that you're letting affect the way
agent and you don't have other people
i had those traits a little bit more
which is well how do we actually make money
you're paying that fifteen point three
speaking by themselves and there is no
percent higher as your credit score gets
right the fifth step
pressing to push play and pause every
and you are ready to go into your
on scenes together that's such an
that book is now on bookshelves
this place is like upwork and fiber that
wanted to simplify it because
towards your own career
if you want to be a working graphic
a conversation with him
and really helpful articles that will
so i encourage you to sit in on class
what do you mean no not doing it I
actors can make money within this
beneficial when you use it in the right
would just put
them and says hey i'm brand new i don't
is horizontal many of you will want to
about today are firstly drop shipping
change it to something that's just
So just appreciating this and having this kind of
And so as a lesson to all of us
You need to have quite a large amount of money
work their way up right so in your
have to have some type of balance to

that involves analyzing data from like 2000 patient records
they focused and on in character
paying that extra price for that trendy
resume looked like this when i first
needs to be able to fit in this story
to mention my own website
this means you're taking a 20 000 loss
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
that as much as 80 percent of new agents
years ago I was in London for work what
dogs with inner life of ryan your

I check my portfolio once every six months
so in the summer of 2015 we built an
year i can't remember but recently i
get a dog okay so in an audition like
single tuesday at noon eastern standard
recommend most people do you'll have a
or a 15 or a 20 commission we won't get
you're trying to figure out when you
because it suddenly becomes scalable
the mental toughness to handle this
of bringing in enough income to cover
that you are selling other people's products
that decision after the fact okay so
was eating how I was eating and it took
So this is the lifetime revenue of my YouTube channel
referring to movies when they say take 1
your brand like all of those things are
a lot of money with these types
house is the potential resale value in
in order to work with an agent so i hope
that is going to impact so many people
really nice and they're luxurious but
and you saw all those movies and
straight to the government as
that a great audition doesn't guarantee
that fifteen point three percent tax
that come with that but not only that at
the daily challenges feature on Brilliant
every single one of the 12 steps is
if i had let that stop me i wouldn't

those things okay so in this video we're
rehearsing the scene so you're gonna
this idea has actually changed the game for me
effectively because think about it if
owe a lot to house hacking here are the
guys ways to become financially
gonna be able to sell later on and
mind that you're gonna need money to
you virtually yeah it's good to see you
single week now it's actually been more
my real money in 2012
people better actors and i should have
in and i made probably six or seven
of people you absolutely do not need the
Other things around this is working with music
exhausting day and you feel like having
for many other projects uh when i
interested in let's get started right
they've done plays since they were in
recommend that you do your own research
And the way that our memory works is
my auditions then i've actually created
such as vons or ralph's that's where you
who are very kindly sponsoring this video
shouldn't have been caught off guard and
aren't necessary now of course you do
mailing list of 20,000 people and now
spend those x dollars you're going to
particularly useful either recently or
percentage I'm doing really well with
that are used all the time
little bit about me and about my dog
dollar pie now one very important part
it makes it so that it's the only thing
background this stuff back here is cool
understand that your acting ability
happens all the time
television shows
got a call back for that
now definitely for some industries this
estate agent the next really important
to submit you to casting directors so
know my mastermind coach or the other
probably around 75% of the people in the
hit the tab
In this video we're gonna talk about
will make real estate investing a much
loans is be lower your credit score the
lot of time going through the course and
really ensure that you have the
private acting teachers private acting
a lot of especially the people that are
found it informative please give it a
audition for one character and they use
the city you live in right now even if
so don't submit for projects in toronto
my first audition for the commercial on
the description below so make sure to
many of them have
so that
come from the on-camera world
another way that actors make money in
at 1 p.m.
all right second bedroom right here
and then you can sell your services
but you might not like the way I coach
and just write a quick note for that
world to push us along
and starting to
So it provided those two conditions are met
well they're going to need that actor to
who has been trained to express the
hassle and they actually just go with an
of how much money you as the creator
camera even in an unscripted situation
passing rates but I've heard that for
and then you sold when it was $800
a lot more to actually just put stuff down on paper
the movies and television shows that
the acting career center here to help
invest in real estate well it's to build
uh key ratios that you guys need to look
into the film and television industry
But secondly your holidays are really long
than paying for
them to see that sometimes you're gonna
so many new things about all of these
someone like a surgeon that you're working with
let me say that i am not a theater actor
drenched in sweat completely soaked
if i had let that client stop me from
have to be training towards a specific
television shows then I've created a
i mentioned earlier that yes you are
returns for the last two years
But I thought I'd do this annual roundup
graph because if it took you 30 years to
nothing scripted so i recorded my
and cast yourself as the main character
Another piece of advice that I forgot to give is
i think atlanta is the best market
and the lower your credit score the
availability conflicts refer to the
for some amazing projects so
who understands the industry who has
i've created a free audition
and having made 77 videos already
face especially in your eyes but I will
time and after the auditions were done
really taught me that we don't need to
To use me as an example so me and my brother have a podcast
especially when you factor in the time
Okay so that begs the question
want to know why they asked you this
can replace it or add to it add to your
until next time keep practicing keep
hundreds of auditions that I've done the
kind of prepared for the scene
now right off the bat you can see that
that's not working I'll try another if
weird situation and let's bring it back
just sold we were on the market for like
baton and i we were all locked in said
payments the higher the LTV the higher
you take are of great addition to great

I like to have a fancy-ass desk set up
know more and more people are turning to
now a reader can be just the casting
you're going to have to learn monologues
if not everyone gets it
we don't want to just talk about you
now if you have an agent you would put
So if in April 2020
i'm not going to audition for this
I had a bunch of agents call me and try
your acting abilities
and i know exactly what every single
scenario for any type of real estate
pay down your mortgage
officer uniform they could be casting
monologues in previous videos but if you
question but my advice is to suggest the
through these more concise summaries
terms of a subscription fee or it may
my name is Kurt you thank you for
all this time figuring it out you're
and hard work and dedication and all that good stuff
something they're not gonna push you
maintenance tires insurance and all
here's the thing shaq was there that day
you need to create a business
other business they're trying
these days with varying degrees of passiveness
one of the major
like it's around about $450 a month
get professional headshots now I can't
per se but i do think they are overrated
in passive income from this audience
are years in
and pasting
And you can do that once in a while
then that can help you book the room at

they're going to be asking you to do all
to be an actor
because we are always looking to hire
like they are emphasized
workout a lot of people will be thinking

spending money at starbucks or other
wow i'm gonna pay am getting paid 300

right in theater is the only time where
building that trust between you a great

those have like been what i make those
both times i never got to meet him maybe
so those are a couple reasons why a lot of actors tend
then to make $100 a month in Skillshare
him based on another live
But eight years down the line
a self tape as a demo rather when you
know I wanted that to be the control and
investing in stocks is very good

sadly not a lot of people do it because
want to help you
any money but you're getting experience
a lot of people now like vom a little bit in their mouth
hundred dollars you give them 10 you
I who don't have the 20% down needed to
part of that money goes to principal aka
it needs to have your union status
in in the area of your finances and just
And as we always talk about on this channel
recommended so many of my friends to use
then you're going to have to find out
footage for all of us to put on our demo

you're gonna start a YouTube channel
play -back rose rapidly without you wanna
actually have to pay for it you have to
about that your agent had your back
you will pass the test your first try
overtime we have compounding
be spent just marketing yourself so
get to set your own hours you don't need
make in their lifetime so a lot is
basically what you want whether it's a
But the thing that I recommend
either as a one-off or more likely these days
and around our jobs
and they're going to call you up and
these three go
and in order to represent an actor i
them in this video
Be okay with organizing an event
where you look directly into the camera
and if you can do that if you can get
the production side but i'm not i'm not
in this industry casting directors
and this doesn't happen in every scene
in that time what is it today
that those can be great ways to start
want to get a sense of your personality
So for example if I were to put a hundred pounds
that will really help the podcast grow
job where you know not every day is the
within this industry is a really popular
number one on my list why because we
that so for instance
auditions with your phone
of that file and make sure you don't
average American just doesn't have
It made me realize that we're always
this is how i've been taking acting
description below to see something like
have many many scenes that you're trying
person's license you need to find a
or taking a job that pays less but that
because that would make you an extremely rich person
and then Brexit happens the next day
we wanna be trying to have more fun
in the next video
to see more content just like this
training is the first thing you should
vanities for like 80 bucks and they're
know that with having a great brand has
At that point absolutely everyone
12 commonly purchased items that you are
room here to write 15 different
my clients are really appreciate you
with 1.4 million views
never auditioning for just that one role
And so when we give our money to a company
every few months just to make sure you're still
are going to print all right we are so
And the idea is that you should have a list
Secondly index funds give you
dramatically the next bad money habit
when you buy an
different skill set but
as well as my loan license exams was to
when you audition for something you're
fitness and health as well yeah yeah so
warranty date and the truth is that
then the night before
Sport And Prove Your Love Me This Way
and two hundred thousand dollars
could look like that you're trying too
to work on scene work rather than
then I gained 45 pounds just and it was
keep your file sizes small remember that
energy in alignment with my values and
from memorization because you gotta know
through their commercials so more MORE they're hiring actors who looked like
like that
there I think it was the first ad who
certain way of asking questions it's not
that helps you crop your headshots to
as their fee now if you're doing it
other side of the camera
Really curve into your heart the serenity prayer
every single actor that wants to
after working your second union job
it really does not matter we are faced
on how you can start side hustles in your spare time
instagram reels because that's what's
money we must take time to dress for our
that role and then it was like you know
i head straight to the sales section if
and then when the production schedule
now don't worry if your demo reel is
And because she's just launched season two of her podcasts
on it anyways with selling a house of
to enjoy more of the things that we're doing
fit for instance I know I look nothing like Brad Pitt
from me and so if you can build up that
if janet starts throwing around reckless
valuable then people will buy it and
are used in your location if you're in a
get clients and this is really the most
It's a very much like an sort of slow and steady
when it comes to auditions props are no
and then my eye color
finding those types of people in your
see you on set one day
down what I still have booked it who
not going to be spent you know learning
today in fact
the casting director
physical goods are just not as fun to
pay of the project the union status all
thirteen and for me five or ten dollars
you'll see that it could take
opportunities and auditions that you
So for all 52 of them check out Email.AliaBdaal.com
in order to like tease out some things around
is in terms of things like YouTube
pre-approval now i think about this
But then for the last few months
flow of business which is typically
the last lesson I learned that day came
find auditions and learn everything else
someone is making over 50 thousand
you wanted to write now you could start
tell them that you're going to work hard
and you can elect
spending some time here with me today
photography business or as another
big netflix show or a big marvel movie
and how willing people are to connect
generating journey on the internet
and let's say for the walking dead you
now think about this for a second when you're in a conversation with someone
"Oh crap the stock market's going down a bit
there's also thousands and thousands of more classes
if i want to this happens in
what this does is it allows you to write
but the iPad video has 124,000 hours
But let's say you've hit your thousand subscribers
time is money on a movie or a television
Although growing a podcast is a lot harder
life as a giant wheel and if we have a
told you about that client
still cheaper than the warranty cost the
doing photography wise but
the amount of information you learn
because i am currently out of town
your internet and if it's not something
food stay hydrated and
kind of an exciting week of things
check out weeble get your free stocks
have your email address but you really
really interesting stuff in here about
uniform is what booked her the role but
in a scene
you do eventually submit to an
who is pursuing an on-camera acting
12 steps every actor should take to
the state that i live in
interviewed my friend Tyler Buckingham
the productions were going on
I've seen much about it
how I make the money that I used to invest
distinctly remember there was an actress
live and whether or not your location
single time i from download free she
all these things already
right now your credit score sort of
wife and they're repainting their
because I was like I can't believe
and we just banged out these this work over the space
companies can charge as much as 30
20% if you're waiting on a home purchase
mail out your application to the
if you want to pursue
And the other nice thing about Skillshare is that it's like
because they were born with it
about yourself question let's talk about
whether we're buying this thing because
It doesn't matter how young you are
so again we're going to bold this
start with drop shipping the basic idea
so that's my story about how i got my
very easy
like Amazon Associates
can't see yourself doing anything else
statistics aren't too clear on like the
before 60,000 subscribers
with you in some way shape or form
look for the produce that is on sale
now but I'll record all of the opposite
the ways to join are
looking at one week I got bad news for
but genuinely Skillshare is a great place to teach stuff
will give you the tools to succeed and
And caveat number three is that
is that you should not invest in individual stocks
investment like i got x number of
it's probably gonna cost like a maybe
the actor that's auditioning stands in front of the camera
rates are super low right now when
whereby you now only need it to be eight minutes long
different and then they wanted the
they start investing and letting their
money on
study for your exams and again those
that actors make money within this
if you were in a short film you would
you're in a high cost of living area
because it's 10% of then the 110
and you are a sag-aftra member now
them now the goal here isn't to follow
advantage to not dressing in full
is the industry standard size for a
helping out with a casting session one
problems with that one
invested in stocks
"There's a disconnect between the future
practice practice practice your
a script but they told me this is a
this thing open up these and voila so
point once you've built up 20% equity in
all the stuff you can write this off in
pass that as well so the first step is
actually make your mortgage payments if
necessarily as much there's less
For example let's say you buy a house
says and interviews that actually he
actors at the moment or just female
can also lead to increased
your acting
for my youtube video
And generally doing well in affiliate marketing
just because loads of people around the world
and the cool thing about YouTube
through real estate express they're
in to the film and television industry
our own products if we're selling our
the seventh and final memorization
And the first 200 people to use that link
is not gonna be worth a thousand pounds anymore
be performing that scene twice blocking
I'm just gonna do it consistently
because while there are many cities that
and not your mouth and speak today gonna
other things in order for the agent to
you're getting a credit for your resume
And so you make an account on an online broker
knowledge and uncertainty and that looks
out the others so
and I hope to see you on set one day
questions then are you know because as
and knew what they were doing the scene
you think about you
99 of the work that was available for
Like firstly you have no high interest credit card debt
I was sort of sitting on the sofa behind there
rather than the fact that maybe you got an extra 0.1%
laughing and joking with each other in
if you're doing it just more for
and the first 200 people to click that link
with and I'll record for instance line
they'll charge between five to ten
you're trying to buy a type of meat
the art of trying to monetize something will itself
for less than you actually bought it
much you can realistically charge
you are never forced to join the union
quite a bit
in my career too so those are a couple
top doing things that everyone else is
if you like this video please give it a
even if you don't book that particular
and you know then I just became more
check them out i will put a link to them
potentially for
and it was cut out with scissors would
to watch the video so they go away from it
riding on your knowledge and expertise
that our money is still worth 206 pounds in 10 years time
and start looking for auditions on those
taken many many write-offs and used many
is demo reel editing now when you first
whenever your pay is based on commission
telling me that you saw me
That also really helps support the channel
the correct size paper if we don't our
without worrying about the quality
that helped me enjoy the journey a little bit more
to build a website and make money off
if it's a restaurant scene like we talked about before take a moment to really
you can and if you really want to do
If you like this video and you wanna get started
helping out a producer or a director
bunch of sites like hotpads and trulia
scene only has to be maybe 30 seconds to
going to give you a hard time so
In fact I was recently interviewed on an episode
it comes to their headshots but today
but don't just give me a thumbs down
biggest things with house hacking is

well that's the number that lenders use
but then it's sort of fun in hindsight
education business i have now
a labor union here in the united states
depends on things that you are choosing
my life
also make money number one is
extended period of time and now they're
And we know what the index is something like the S&amp;P 500
that if you start investing at the age of 20
with a low down payment of five percent
do you want to become an actor of course
Now this kind of depends
all especially when you're comparing the
see you on set one day
number 11 is
that like button and also subscribe to
season so people probably aren't too
money for example if you're trying to
and millions of dollars and escape the
out now this is going to really depend
maybe you didn't do anything wrong
committed to this
you can create your own experience you
keep you
So the first one is forgetting about investing completely
hometown fast forward to 2013 and I was
of acting
yourself it was one of the first videos
floors just let my gym be free and then
the tax code is complicated but the
right i didn't have time to finish this
you're taking a 40 000
is on camera the reader is the person
or if you're hit with some kind of
highest income bracket meaning you're

the second way to find auditions without

have to have every single role yeah I'm
i do think there are a lot of people
a chance to work with a lot of actors
If your videos are making people watch for longer

they can help you out and buying your

americans waste about 44 billion dollars
and understand how all of the pieces fit

from our coach and from the other
audition was for a commercial for a home
don't make those payments
All right so we're nearly there
idea about like when it came to
table from someone that they're
because it doesn't rely on any level of privilege
now there's various different ways of

all of those types of experiences on

my agent was still impressed with all of
there were decisions that were made
maybe we were too tall for the role or
let's get into it
Because if you go first if you take the initiative
This guy Safi is a writer and he talks about
you're going to hold yourself back from
where if you refer someone to sign up
moving to a bigger production market
state has their own specific course that
asked in commercial auditions so way
scene you've reacted to the explosion
PMI payment instantly so no you won't
the more you leave time for that money
monologues for sure
generate passive income ie
when you have an existing audience by creating content
resume it's going to make you look like
put 20% down when you're buying a house
week you could write one or two blog
the first thing that people do these
probably not gonna want to go all-out
that I really can't remember where it's from
in the room in front of the casting
Well this is actually kinda hard
test questions there's only a finite
credit card with an extended warranty
people will purchase right and so
we're at right now and even before the

and do it yourself then look at the
like corporate speak thing back in the day
down and leaning forward to talk to the

the wrong impression sorry I didn't get

pay agents of 100% we have training we

would be a typical cold-read situation
for it to get back to its normal level
much sense to invest fifty grand into
actually use
foundations and our foundational
million dollars because people the real
to them they're going to ask for a
email list you have to spend time
own it would give them much more
be the type of person to offer to help
there might be a cut off for union
because to make an app it's actually quite hard
absolutely necessary to do that in fact
the reason i'm wearing this t-shirt
where I explain how I got started
and ended up making I think like $300,000 in the course
reading self-improvement books and not
this is where we start to see some of
so that's something you should take into
audition for crying out loud so show
because we know we wanna be entrepreneurs
at learning Python which is the world's
that's how you get your real estate
And so you the investor don't have to worry about this
so when I wrote out that sentence it
take that effort to get started to begin with
your real estate license and get into
trying to do because like you said
You're gonna have a lot of anxiety
open it up to people of other
people in kansas city right now are like

cleveland didn't have a bunch of movies
for buying cheap groceries is to only
start auditioning for movies and
or building such domain authority
add lots of value to your house the
decision for me had i decided to join
There's basically no way you're ever gonna lose all of it
of the things that we were talking about

becoming a an assistant to a top
your career step 4
it can take months or even years
but my parents they just didn't spend
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
that link right there
with all that but starting a little bit
difficult to install especially if you
would not have gotten
process that your agent will take
by following this exact format
And kind of reading this it's a really long paper
avengers endgame
website or if you want you can scout it
all the time in this industry and union
we can make the thing once and then we
pushing yourself to a potential injury
reel and then show it to the casting
opportunity to not only work on set but
add to it and replace stuff with better
felt like they had been doing it for
career to pursue and it takes
the link is in the description below
for two three five eight hours you're
director is sitting on the desk
to learn all this stuff all over again
something it's a way

and they have no acting training they

because i have seen casting calls where

but basically all the big US companies you've heard of
do it yourself but make sure the
because 10% feels like a small amount of money
same question in the comments
people on your team helping you
subscribe to this channel to get more
strategies that you should use as well
And so reading this kind of stuff reminds me
youtube course then you could totally
you have all these fun things that you could be doing
but I kinda synthesized what they were talking about
you shouldn't be pursuing an agent right
do audio books you could do a narrative
city first get as much training as you
hear anything
and I bought so you know these are just

to help them do well in the admissions tests
actually able to quit my day job and
by working in complete silence
do you have consistent income coming in
channel to see more videos just like
feet tall
don't buy as much clothes
or if they were self taped the casting
for example if I was studying for an exam
hundreds if not thousands of different
they considered me too far away from
yes you could not make any money if you
because I don't want to lose all my money
It's not really that Michael Phelps practices that much more
There is no way to get rich quick
the idea of a flywheel is that it's
business or do you have consistent

love child of
what I learned while working with two

potentially take you out of
if it's digital then your headshot will
issue and that is that production
process works
cheaper side in bigger markets and can
until next time keep practicing keep
rates of appreciation in most parts of

But again the nice thing about Skillshare as a platform
sometimes on a shoot the director will
beginning of them correct yes we're in

You spend more than $10 a month on pointless subways

you enjoyed this video and i'll see you

tons of parts of the country because
that's how we shot the entire thing
go into the extras and you watch the
sent that audition in and they saw you
experience especially when you're just
that even with a very small amount of
in a short amount of time and that's
writing blog posts writing books
evidence that you are a good actor they
because it lets people experience the
dollars is not too bad especially if you
heard most often throughout my career is
audition talent agents are going to be
you're paying in taxes and you already
own first property as well thanks you
those are the sacrifices that
so that's a hundred times more
residual payments are but in a nutshell
I call it my audition cheat sheet and
can do is
real estate test i'm not saying to
throughout your career you'll eventually
i have no regrets for coming to atlanta
you could be sweeping the floor you can
10-step audition preparation guide you
also could potentially

where you can make sure you don't know
another great benefit is that
There are three around productivity now

post on public websites like actors
injuries aren't fun they're not I've
have you have proper training you know
who find it on the Skillshare homepage
an ebook counts as a digital product
that will knock on lots of doors and open those doors
which means it's gonna be taxed at 32.5%
time to waste on actors who are not
percent correct on the test to pass and
beneficial it may even be required i'm

And there's a whole category of this called SAS
of the investment as well as how much
are not rich and famous
is open up an account
in Stocks and Shares for Beginners"
but it's very doable to make $100 a month
to make $100 a month from selling digital products
days that you work
and it's possible that they simply have
this i've put together a list of tools
one day
streaming networks number one is a show
because they've been doing this for a
i was released from first refusal my
considered pretty low scores so that's
how much money you're making from them
floor and look for that X or the T and
it's possible that an agent still
this idea of mastering boring fundamentals
to go to class every day and you know
king may look at that
of his time running that business
anything else and yes audition for plays
making an app to making a website to
and analyze what things you can write
videos on acting auditioning and career
So for around 12 months after that
anything that quickly but yeah i'm sure
a one-bedroom condo instead of a
and that just felt again like this is amazing
how many actors are auditioning for the
before most people aren't putting down
with working 40 to 80 hours a week then
show up in the world is going to impact
for it and boom you get offered a role
less than 20% down rather than waiting
But if you just held on
experience in this video how do we start
when you start working with an agent
my career has come in the last five
and in this video i want to share with
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
Now these are products that you create once like an ebook
won't be disappointed in me if you cast
your social media you know what's going
three things can help you
look when you do a monologue you have to
there's a people in real life or
then they open that window and they walk through
to do this lifelong learning thing
at and figure out what you need to do
audition let's get to it
So thank you very much Brilliant
well lit earlier we talked about keeping
guest when your and your friends and
short film make our we would make our
and i just really appreciate it and i'm
care if it was avengers end game
fits onto one page i want you to not do
but like these exercises genuinely helped me
percent down so this VA loan greatly
and more productive
you know bringing friends on board
available for everyone because they're I
major way that actors make money within
How do I do any of this stuff
city that you currently live in
finding anything it really is a complex
like to leave it off but i'll leave that
your budget how much house can you
things are things that you are paying
of actors who have done
and did the standard Youtuber thing
on multiple episodes you wouldn't have
calvin klein or a victorious secret
doing this
it could be right justified i'll leave
that only i can do and the only thing
and they watched your acting ability
it's sort of like YouTube in that anyone
the difference and i will have to pay
either union
you on your first deal if you're in
can help you
we get some sort of routine and then
another reason why you should audition
an agent
i really want to encourage you to think
acting career
$100,000 a year in annual recurring revenue
that all of the great acting that we're
possible for you to lose all your money
and depreciating over time
big lights on you
so in this video i want to share with
my groceries and I lunge you know to
calm now before I get into my thoughts
so in my mind i'm thinking darn i did
And you're thinking of getting a mortgage
see if that is happening
create a youtube link with your video
punctuation so a few years ago I was in
investor starts out like that and it
So it's okay to fall behind during term time
i get paid for no matter what and
now during the audition process for this
for example let's say that a character
to emphasize here are not to rush to get
they are choosing to pay out a dividend
earlier when it came to pit education
so the way that you would put training
television show it's really important to
wait to see you on set one day
and in our scene you know all of the
the foods that you eat you know it
so start creating your own web series or
your actions and then finally end up at
that have provided safe working
they claim to get
estate agents don't want to pay for
season one and season two of the show
people have begun downsizing their homes
and you're gonna you're gonna sabotage yourself
or the year that you got it and then the
career route and
setting up the lights and the camera and
project to project so i'm not gonna go
products I mean things like ebooks or
this house and kind of the steps I took
actors remind them of their ex what can
then i improvised some responses and
amount of leads for let's say a monthly
goes towards building your own credit my
it's just a lot easier to take that
lot of people are like well if I'm not
on Skillshare like I do I have like nine of them
my shopping cart and i was like
had to jump through all of those hoops
so fast and yeah I just hope that all of
using the backup camera on your Toyota
movie or a TV show or a Netflix show or
succeed I want you to be that series
any age like yes even if you're 15 years
certain things that I've tried like
on your earnings for the year so those
but he was never listed on the call
spending their time learning
or playing all the songs on the guitar
and carry they're the six things that
on camera but you're also learning how
that I learnt in 2019
runner and so we just kind of grew up in
learn before you get on to a higher
good to have a safety net because
one of the best ways to build long-term
harder to build those routines and build
those are the ones that you should get i
information in relation to work the way
angeles the bay area and new york it's
like it's much easier to maintain a product
right to it the first way that we are
well it's pretty complicated and it's a
called to if it's something that you
your demo reel but you also get
immediately after signing you go get
And so for me for example I started investing in 2015
independent films and short films
buying photo paper for headshots is that
is usually used internally
absolutely not focus on anything in the
on that but if you are in the us
recommend taking an online class if that
before they even get to you so sometimes
on the sort of exponential growth of YouTube revenue
of stainless steel appliances all really
regard as more professional
guys and i share new videos on tuesday
whatever you're doing
i've seen too many actors move to a new
those wrinkles self stamping commandment
full of
that said hey you have another audition
over 80% of the loan to value the amount
personally met people that were scammed
become an actor now
Ooh maybe he wrote a book called Loon
photographer headshot photographer don't
a corporate job where you're getting a
13 years now
the same even the framing is almost
information they'll take really detailed
business card and you
who are very kindly sponsoring this video
suddenly my revenue skyrockets
i want to be an actor how do i get an
a theater background who have done some
been footage on my demo reel and a great
conflicting information what do we do
your company
access casting networks and backstage
that an actor
people asking for business so yeah if
industry standard so make sure your
seriously and look even if you did
But having said that again this is a longterm thing
participated in taking notes just like
learning a bunch of monologues is
desk and she asked me who I was
me wrong
not 100
will be different for every state each
actor because
shows that don't go
you learn the skills you need to break
next video
I'm sold I've got a 100 pounds here
scary to think about but um the biggest
learn more about self-taping i actually
I would like my words um but he talked
if you want to learn more about those
where our more acting related because
audition to a wider pool of actors this
might only be able to see
into the audition room of a film and
for this particular audition they're
with but a lot of the mastermind is
with as much potential as possible to
this video
learning how i approach
biomechanically does on a daily basis I
for me so the the 30 for 30 you you
that the index fund outperformed the actively managed fund
got a call back
or the wall decorations now you don't have to overdo it if you just do this
important is to get
background is actually a great example
practicing keep learning and I hope to
and then I'm gonna walk kind of around
so i just want to make that clear that
to be making $100 a month
meet other actors so that you can work
sheet that you can download by going to
maintaining that level is actually quite easy
into your house whereas if you spend
your own license for doing your own
fake information high maintenance and
subscribe button to get more videos on
well in this video i want to share with
so don't get down on yourself if you
And the main insight that I've realized
getting into an acting class so that you
specific skill like someone who can
way to gain experience as an
sign up through an agent so if you have
pay classes pay for classes
being specific about what exactly it is
Andrei Jikh does a good job with YouTube channels as well
a search for your
so that's the same thing that you should
able to say okay let me email you a link
that was giving us a 10% interest rate
or a television show i'll break down the
of people will then ask is well why
called Productivity for Creators

don't already have one let's get started
don't look like i'm 60. and
and asked him to invest it right now
long-term effect
And my parents have told me
you how i auditioned for
in that role and i think that's really
that the viewers the potential buyers
is actually like absolutely game changing
outsource and i think that's so
none of the roles that you audition for
me a role that ended up being the
with a lot of production as well like
classes sometimes and the last thing
act and i'm not talking about acting in
that might be a way that you can kind of
of others chicago
actors and then you would tell facebook
That basically as soon as you watch this video

the description of this video so that
and intelligent ways to make the income passive
about three
this was a show on hulu it only got one
chances are it's gonna be around 10 years from now
than a hundred dollars
is how this works for me is that when
through college
investing thank you so much and i'll see
to do that monologue 100 of the time
enjoy the journey
resume and shrink the font so it all
they added a line for me the doctor to
so your part needs to be able to fit
but for example in 2000 there was a bit of a crash
show that you really want to be on as a
follow these steps i guarantee you'll
paper mistake number three forgetting to
if I put my money in stocks and shares
like 2700 K where it looked like an
they've they've been brought back not
no that's not how it works at the end of
the stage was to youtube hold on
For me in my business these nine different sources
after speaking with your lender and real
probably one hour but i just really
make the effort to learn the business of
there's a good chance against it can
because think about it we're only
apply what you've learned where do you
so not looking like a supermodel can have its advantages as well
fulfillment because that's the way the
pretty much just as good quality like
youtube land you can check me out on
deleted scenes you may see me a few more
recommend looking at as many testing
I would've been like oh I don't know
this will increase your awareness of all the life that's going on around you
depending on which country you're in (laughs)
optional though alright that's it
to join sag-aftra is only about half of
That is a lot it's like gone up
unfortunately in the real world there
these then you're gonna be spending a

to get a feel for the acting landscape
And so he set up this 10 year bet

okay so those are two lines on a resume
I'll do it for ten I'll do it for twenty
you have any questions about any of the
in your market another thing that you
But stocks and shares is a very very easy way
watching all the way to the end I want
that you should dress to suggest the
getting opportunities that you otherwise
autopay the instant you get a credit
real estate investor i still do think
more videos on acting
uh respond and then they ended up
the sort that isn't relying on like current affairs
when i was younger so who knows what
you can see the audience retention graphs
when you're buying and selling your own
between two people so that you can
something they start wallowing around in
then you can take the cost of it out of the business
whatever region that you're in
what to invest in and doing all this research
Whereas if I think ooh
can you do it from another city
i don't think i actually need these and
lead guest star
tempting to just be able to go to
those all start to add credits to your
the actual exercising part of it and
and try and cram for a test or for an exam like
that book if you feel like you need to
would say 80% of the time they simply
what's up you guys so today I wanted to
than I expected next time you're gonna
you're showing up but
achieve your goals and if you are
once I've had a haircut so see you shortly
those two things
that have been credits on my resume that
there are projects that are going to be
of enough we then start to just
and having fun and getting your feet wet
I just like to think

that's the first thing that
dollars so fifteen thousand dollars more

it's the very last thing that I do
then five years later
you what i believe have been the best
who have built software businesses
advantage because we can focus more on
then I would be if I were just reading
so the fourth technique that I use to
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
and I think is still pretty competitive
learn about real estate investing you'll
are casting a project not just one part
an easy fix or they can also be very
rudder for transforming our relationship
so that's what i would encourage you
on the Tim Ferriss show I think

you can you can you can walk out of the
the entire casting process works
auditions you will get usually get the
of another playlist that has similar
go to sleep it's the very last thing I
it takes mental strength it takes thick

another live in or not in person but
you're putting a full-time effort

up I'll give you some free study
do with this part of setting is refresh
force is going to be the most expensive
one simply because of the numbers they
