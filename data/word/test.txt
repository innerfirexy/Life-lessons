myself a different deadline than the
creativity and potential revenue and
instances where that has happened before

during that conversation she

directors and the producers thought that
hang out we're typically right here in
importance of acting class but this is
productions are looking for someone who
Let's go
are at home all day some days we're on
actor because nobody starts with acting
where internally I was not okay with it
this was never this one hand it is how
is a mindset shift
with at least a few options it's always
take this

not going to be your forever home so
role if you're not okay with this and it
especially when
and in those cases i would recommend
put those plays on your resume as well
work as an actor you have to audition
little bit weird like stephanie like
accidentally deleted that last clip so i
that has a section on your resume as you
posted publicly so we're talking movies
this becomes like relatively reasonable passive income
a free 10-step audition preparation
it looks like this is the big kitchen
was there something you think I left off
in inverted commas for the things
and personally I will be more than happy
first email about that audition from my
meisner technique
and then you will film on set
license can take a lot longer than you
which is the course i recommend there
actors tend to do this well I can't speak for everyone but I can tell you
careers in
your student you can just study at night
have the exact answers for you but
definitely don't skimp on the kitchen
into the film and television industry
nobody needs to zoom in on your face and
but then like the layout doesn't really

towards it and we got to be there for

refusal and then finally
again this is an exchange of value we
And to be honest it's not even about the money
many things that go into it and i feel
your first time here first of all
as you walk from the living room here
look I'm not telling you to never dress

outside of class let me say that again
recommend you research universities and

and then Myspace crushes and then you've lost all your money
in theater then i'm probably not the
because then you will completely waste the next day
know I teach classes from there that's
to not feel like you're just stuck and
purchase one of your website templates
most people to avoid doing background
got a good idea of what's written at
about next so cool because people
to try to take pictures
and all of your marketing materials that
resume your acting resume will always be
making those connections now if you've
different gender than you this happens
below as well we'll be sure to put all
trying to do as well so it's extremely
reasoning for them
the next question is where should you
is what's the best place to live
house hack is to buy a fixer-upper for
and that
want to be an actor and then you should
and he kind of popped his head in the
all the time because that's what they
that's far more likely to end up in a long-term memory
then you really will have to move to the
a costume then by all means do it a lot
online classes you also don't need to
they want they can pay whatever wages
maybe I just kind of move through it and
when your headshot goes to a casting
the character when it comes to you
teacher right so let's say instead you
access and casting networks and things
In my opinion whether you're 12 or 20 or 21 or 22 or 50
trivial but in an industry that is as
greenland hasn't come out in the united
state to buy rental properties now if
now if you do a great job with this mock
sharing of ideas kind of field content creation
languages of websites and then because I
getting your real estate license in my
you're watching this video you're
I said I've seen it work for some people
each area and property is going to be
I would have had when I first got
well I actually have two answers one for
is run and you're getting paid you're
joining me here today if you haven't
online I taught myself HTML and CSS
I'll try and speed up
there are many business expenses that
help with taxes but that's not the truth
So to start making money on YouTube
because investing in stocks is the easiest way
years old and they're an adult
until noon I no matter what I wake up
below it's a list of cameras and lights
of actors say that they want to act in a
people if you've got the right audience
why am i getting this audition why would
and you can't kill anything
really wasteful water bottles it's going
for a new marvel show
will hear at an audition you definitely
right there on the spot
keep practicing keep learning and i hope
background work out of your career
representation and they'll sign you
depending on the printer you may need to
you decide to join the union
have 1 000.
if you took classes in a in an acting
debate or perhaps use it to negotiate
I'll give them stuff to do so that
Oh yeah we were talking about why it's not a good idea
which is all about how I'm figuring out
kinds of different office products
multiple different
and photo paper we are just about ready
acting ability eventually you'll be
only a small
you're paying anywhere between 20 and up
great price range and it's gonna hold up
uh did all of our prep work before going
which is pretty awesome from something
For example most of my videos
you've read the summaries of
mortgage your rent your utilities
your future goals are to become
a brand new actor who's just starting
and what you're gonna do in those
"needed to build a strong foundation."
you have to become eligible first and
projects and maybe the first few things
auditions and she mentioned a potential
enjoyed the video make sure to hit that
united states i know in other countries
episodes series regular is one of the
savings account you're increasing the
terms that you have heard that I didn't
business owners so the mastermind that i
or at least move
roster of actors of all ages of all
up if you haven't already
if you are watching this video it means
Well again this is not quite passive income
courses each being 45 hours you can
best bet this is because if you want to
there are two sorts of people
For context my junior doctor salary
ended up being offered and then they
but I read the whole thing 'cause it was a riveting read
with another person that's that's a lot
taking this is really
casting standpoint what the casting
that these people get really good at stuff
alright I'm gonna get three square meals
the Muhammad Ali method
rent that out you can also convert
drinker drinks
started to potentially audition for
closing deals can be very sporadic
that in your life
actually train and mentor you to be
google drive i'll put the link down in
process after you've memorized it all
And this was something that me and my brother
certain actors simply because those
a brita or
seriously a lot of these generic brand
these in my opinion are the three
gonna give you
you get diversification
knowing that you were created with
a lot to pay for some people and there
features that change with your new by
actual lines and you just start looking
helps to support it
forget to get your free audition cheat
you've decided that you know what
the description of this video so you can
as something that has truly transformed
so after i got released i just assumed
better for the environment all right
in this video I want to share with you
you to show them your work to show them
months first year so after they don't
and you call it a day
all the expression changes anything
that actors
are projects that will probably not pay
confidence comes from somewhere else
vocabulary to define fast bad wrong
there's just way too many temptations in
shipping I also don't like the fact that
For most of these videos
And then Bob would types and stuff into his computer
truly believe
up and if you have any questions
like starting a YouTube channel
expertise and that's where i've really
think it really depends on your state
really easy to understand manner and it
there's a lot that you do need to learn
real estate about personal finance
important role
headshot and your information
obviously the more rentable units the
or I felt like ugh I'm not being productive enough
you know perfect tie-in with Fitness's
movie can be 30 pages 50 pages 100 pages
Because when it comes to studying for my exams
publicly so that actors cannot access
community theater where you can get
is I could bring friends on board
they already know that you're an actor
not get to see normally and by becoming
first 20 to 30 seconds so you want to
die per se no he have to die okay how
life energy for our life energy is
that joy had I not kind of written the day off
i can send you these are the summaries
transforming your relationship with
lunch and it's like okay so what are you
like you know it's no fun playing a game
and the second is paying down your
we want them to show us that they are
so what this body weight class does is
you're in it for the long haul
higher your interest payments are going
this industry whenever there's a big
to help me book over 50 movies and
Netflix shows that most people are
small-market actor calm now way back in
to be honest
And I talk about quite a lot of these in my online classes
that you want to sell you can actually
audit sheet that you can download by
half but if i were to book a job
doesn't it doesn't make sense so you
is how i
hardwood floor they're gonna be a lot
anywhere in the world no matter what
that goes into doing a play but
Facebook has 2.2 Alphabet which is a Google makes 1.5
united states on december 18th
long it doesn't cost a lot of money to
selling your services this one's
director might say you know what I
productions you're kind of just trusting
so i really do that is one of my regrets
here's the other thing about demo reels
money saved up in the bank it also means
remember this is just how you get
audition notices that I've personally seen written on them in big bold
have acting work which is fantastic but
it'll add value to my performance
well in this video I show you why that
coffee shop
do you start working as a real estate
which is called the Part-Timer YouTuber Inner Circle
the residual payments do not get paid to
once you tell everybody about yourself
push forward anyway have confidence in
it down to your
survival jobs so how can we build an
12 hours of studying into the day before
and follow your passion
who are giving you that level of a sponsorship deal
to your actual shoot on time they can't
So we can see in May 2018 16 pounds 72
and then that will be me getting some affiliate income
soon as possible since you're able to
this lets you compare between different
auditions there will be no blocking
my real estate courses
today we're going to be talking about
declining each year since 2015. now this
But that's quite hard to do no one sticks to it
and that's the perfect transition
I could go home and film a video that results in a video
And so I'm a real big believer of having
it shows us that you can cry and it
how much does it cost to get started you
that's because that's where 99 of the
and everything that works yeah
try to hire a different actor
really effective when I do them together
immediately and then they did the scene
know gives people access to medical
i.e people visiting the thing versus people actually
without being distracting and if I do
downloaded my free 10 step audition
you're working for your full-time job
no idea what are the determining factors
trying to charge people for things and
four ways to get auditions without an
it not been for the great agents i've
the 12 steps you need to take to start a
and the payments are for future uses
unprofessional because it looks like you
as much money as possible so let's get
financial bureau policies credit card
Loads more links in the video description
This is generally easier than starting a YouTube channel
which is what kind of incentivizes YouTubers
so just be aware of that and be ready
acting studios that have classes
now this is the step where you actually
schedule like a lot of actors do it's
everyone should try and overcome
you have an s corp and you have a
these costs
money and you guys i can upload a
estate course
of performance depending on
instead of studying
gonna be under $100 so it is extremely
the difference in delaying your
This should be really hard
and then coming down to atlanta i put on
movie or a show
school play to get involved in drama
commercials because they are just
auditioning and career advice every
fourth tax strategy is to definitely
someone who has made that happen
that if it sounds too good to be true
Maybe you've heard on the news about
to perform one of my monologues
Sitting on here it would be quite fun
and create breakdowns for those roles a
using props unless I really feel like
acting classes
with you and at this point you need to
commercial Union status can refer to
there are very few things in acting in
actor has certain characteristics that
i've never lived in hollywood
a link to it
for the door knockers you don't know what
and that will be good for the environment in the long term
want so if you're working full-time or
that's it for this video if you liked it
two i think the experience that you get
audition for the movie won't back down
where you are not given the sides or the
fully cover the mortgage and cost of
television show and i shared a couple
that is your head shot in your resume
you film them and then you edit them
female deputy because they wanted to
but if you look historically
significant other has a credit score of
our careers
the producers of the show and the
to make passive income and to use my personal example
that i would give and i do think that's
so if you are already following casting
that how is that actually an investment
with it and to be honest i probably
money by actually performing
you have tons of cash to blow those look
you will do awesome i guarantee it so
only communication between the casting
you're buying a duplex then you only
seriously you have unique gifts
the on the other side of the camera on
I was already feeling like I was winning at life
are so many other aspects of this career
and of us because i have in the
to work as like work equals suffering
that basketball analogy
Usually this is because people click on a video
on the performance of the stock market overall
is that you would give the student
movies that are quote unquote hollywood
throughout the semester
cut that together and create a demo reel
are out of our control as actors
little risky at first hiring someone new
get your money out it's just a waste and
great if you are starting out yeah if
It's my video about how to make money online
experts aren't fond of investing in
or a production so a performer an actor
you would be making roughly $100 a month
of course not every area is going to
them believable and compelling such as
buckingham Fitness on the on the route
then i've created a free audition cheat
know how you would answer tell me about
and you don't have to pay any payroll
not about what you say it's about how
gonna be okay in there yeah that's great
your city or maybe in a city
exactly what all of those means in this
the characteristic that they are
cents a square foot to five ten dollars
your head and just shoot a scene like
10 steps that i use to help prepare the
the market will always go up
video we are talking about
determines so many different things for
so george lucas the name of the director
doesn't require me to travel all that much
a job that can actually be very flexible
I'm gonna put that link down in the
sheet that you can download from the
gonna have to do a little bit of work
arrange the logistics and the shipping
You're gonna think that summarizing your notes is helpful
the benefit of lifelong learning
short films in my acting classes me and
18 is not you're too young
generate around $27,000 per week
makes us feel like unprofessional actors
And so if we do some back of the envelope calculations
buy a home with a VA loan right now it's
the show ordinary joe i worked on
buy a house i always tell people
if you make um macrame things for people
weeks now
earn $20,000 a year which is $1,660 a month
10 plus years all right that's it for
that I didn't take that role as tough of
which is absolutely huge
someday move to the united states no
of productivity that you are out
every single actor would get a chance to
you reach 20% equity you can just get
without directly having to charge for them
high school gym class all right so that
their homes with their significant other
saw the house two days before the actual
important decision it's a big decision
uh your down payment amount it'll also
will just be less stressful and most
to be able to loan money to people that
that link is also in the description
movies and television shows
when it's really really busy is like
in really great shape they're gonna be
which I have to say is pretty good
by the time you guys see this video that
actors usually don't know where the next
area that the house is in because you
let's say you did a short film or a
every actor can expect to spend some
store and so putting this all together
to pay the difference so it's not like
the final casting decision they may have
forward and and with that you offer that
but I don't consider this house an investment
you don't want just to copy and paste of
mentioned earlier that's the only
they could potentially add footage to
a lot of the success disproportionately
thank you for shouting me out and
think a solid color wall is the best
either the industry or I have presented
easier to find people who are willing to
I'm gonna share with you everything that
you're deciding where you want to move
for a different role for that movie
Brilliant have paid me to do that particular sponsor plug
by just doing what everyone else is
dvd so if somebody buys a dvd of a
And so when I remember to have fun
and why is that it's because
be much higher at about 2.25 percent so
everything alone um they are incredible
work does not
to google and search for emory
get an offer accepted
have gone okay yeah oh I can't find
information of how they what they can do
that's helped me book over 50 movies and
have marketing materials send me a DM if
keeping people poor
always fair like this credit score
So if you're a business owner
and you're it's another opportunity to
only actor in the room who had the full
if you're interested in that video i'll
on youtube and when you improve yourself
getting paid for it nobody's asking them
websites that may cost some money in
throughout most of it and I was really
insurance for a VA loan but the thing
up it could be a wider full body shot
that position
sometimes you're really busy sometimes
that has been valuable over a long period of time
to make that happen and i say that fully
for a brokerage make sure to hit me up
of how we can make money in our careers
while maintaining those expenses
I was gonna make 700 quid in a day from YouTube ads
and the medical student has to try to
because Apple is a very valuable company
so let's say you book a role on stranger
couple things I wanted to talk about
so assume you were in a short film
what it means to be both union and
make a resume like this regardless of
remodel can range anywhere from a few
in sugars I'm pretty sure ninety percent
because that's where the majority of
house hacking it helps to have a clear
that so
number two is just to be in the game and
there you will find commercials on there
beginners but i think anyone will find
generational wealth you can have cash
every single time that you have one and
star in exchange for some money and
personally our water heater just like
and final column here is going to be the
as small well one thing you can do is to
this audience of people who know like
side and not have to look at where I'm
mastermind members and that like has
if you liked the video make sure to hit
acting career well you'll find about 500
every single day paying for convenience
and acting here in the united states
and easiest longterm investment strategy for most people."
So please please please do not try
by VA approved lenders and they're
then some people are likely to do that thing
definitely a long time so that's why
other rooms or other units now if you're
traditional 401k i won't get into too
then i've created a free audition cheat
about the latest productivity app
the people that you know it's the people
on an acting resume so i do not want to
is going to be at least a few hundred
is that really worth it on that note one
scenarios that an audition room could believably represent
get a thousand people following you on
subscription but yeah those are the
hope everything we just talked about
well you you can actually
single 137 that's that was just 2 years
about this how about this what if the
time if this is your first time here
that you're able to support yourself and
easy is it going to be to sell this
didn't want to have to create all that
agent to sell their first home and this
this is probably going to be a parent or
because you know they have no money
and then you have something to show them
nobody has that kind of power I've
with about 160 000 members
But this 50k isn't what the car actually cost to me
other because they have to have some way
sooner rather than later
when i was acting in cleveland ohio
laminates or a wood countertop you still
i'm in the midst of actually hiring
however as you move forward in your
you're basically standing in for the
or thousands of dollars per year number
about your specific city a lot of people
hook that you're launching every time
agents and casting directors that live
definitely check out real estate express
and four episodes per month
property then you can rent out those
ninety percent of the work is still on
all all they knew was
movies and tv shows now and i've gotten
going to have some type of social media
you care about making money online and
plays in the community this obviously is
that I've made around tips for entrepreneurs
audition or i go on 20 auditions and i
ordinary joe i also have a few projects
course they're gonna be comfortable and
keep going to acting class in your
buckingham fitness what's up Tyler how
relevant right now and what is you know
naysayers wrong
of the annual premium subscription
from the podcast overall from brand deals
the real estate industry so the first
photo paper now matte photo paper is
There's like lots of interesting numbers
automatically built in with that you
down to 50,000
so if you've been an extra in a movie i
since then but I actually found that one
and one book that i really recommend
and you're gonna wish that damn
should be doing and what you can be
demo reel
going to move on to the next person who
new york city and atlanta those are the
it comes from something that's
and ask us with its walls and ends with
money you're putting in and you're
on your iPhone or phone whatever phone you're using
doing something else while doing that
you're automating and streamlining as
getting released that i've worked on
affiliate partnerships with certain
gonna that's you know all of us people
throughout space but also how its
lenders as long as you have above a 740
basically my whole goal is to teach you
student films
they look very modern and they're gonna
university professor just just be
those student films again
you get the returns and I take a 1% or 2% management fee
and a couple lights while recording your
So that's pretty good
get a chance to act and get a chance to
colleges and universities even community
people are watching your videos
you were an actor in the movie and your
blone programs out there that let you
shouldn' I Be Without You Turn On Your
have some health complications
to see more videos
actors with it so yeah the main the main
which leads to sellers wanting to go on Amazon
20 or 30 actors that means for each
But then over time
other videos the first step to pursuing
fulfillment becomes more deeply embedded
say is always do a home inspection i've
you on they get you off and your days
some of these smaller
three union background vouchers so if
part of the flooring the floors
comments below
and I thought that by maintaining eye contact it would show how
never be in a situation where you're in
lasting fulfillment and beyond that peak
you're going to find that an acting
acting is an evidence-based profession
your shoulders in building your career
build wealth and set yourself up for the
let's open it up to a wider pool of
want to pursue
business and i personally love it it's a
was vegan for some time it became a
to see if a
and interior design and all sorts of cool stuff
oh have I made money have I made money
But it's like 600 people out of an audience of 600,000
okay so i think there are two big
prove to an agent that you are taking
because you can teach things on Skillshare
really trust that person and they really
right now that's how you stand out from
opportunities out there
And then you can start kind of killing some stuff
reps actors for stage work
with holding rental properties i just
and you're not in the UK where medical care is free
in that we have to do these boring fundamentals
happen to fit well then your chances are
haven't and I'll see you guys next time
thing that you write in the commercial
particular scenes of a project so you
it is very easy to get your license like
did we met was it at Sunwest Park but we
this means they have no other income
like this will be a big factor in their
unfortunately the audition room is a far cry from a real restaurant
guys you
they're running a business and they're
or a Nobel prize or to be a boxing champion
and then you can delegate outsource automate
this is super important because 8 by 10
it's okay if not everyone understands
and career advice every single week
in urban justice
the limitations of a small market
and do the things that you enjoy
may or may not be possible depending on
what's a good amount of time to be
why our job is not to book the role and
starting out doing commercials and
life to your cabinets and it's going to
possible while this certainly helps you
since I first came across this
logical order to cover things so first
name is alex collins and he talks about
is a waste of time for the most part
buy a home much sooner than if they were
your financials
is a little bit of luck to this
in the description below
financial reasons that it's
many bedrooms which means that you can
the dreaded tell me about yourself
it really changed my mindset when it
can pretty much learn anything online
i do know actors that have spent over a
smaller market might cost a little bit
So it's not too hard to maintain that level of support
be playing the game that you have found yourself playing
out and buy a fancy camera for taping
to $65,000 per month in purely passive income
investors but the loan terms are way
turn your trips into business trips go
have a five hundred thousand dollar
i have never once in my entire 13-year
there are services that can do that for
members of the mastermind has been
is the first step for every aspiring
investments in my business just as a
that you go to probably won't matter
now they are easily
I'm reading it out loud and I'm writing
to show you an example of how I would
but if maybe we're not entirely happy
throughout my career
if you'd invested 10 years ago in Tesla
because if you cannot do it for you and
Therefore it's gonna continue to do the same
pool of actors
money come tax season
It's kinda like having something on Netflix
gigabyte of video right my audition
if you want to be cast in a movie or a
time in in the acting actor's career
I'm gonna take my money
public casting websites now in north
friends have informed when i needed you
standard on a resume there is some
working conditions for
if you like the video give me a thumbs
in every movie and show has
as she would be making on a different kind of topic video
first house will live there generally
write the name of your school in this
room and and said goodbye
because you're actively searching for
master walk-in closet pretty good-sized
and really for all the stuff just move
single week as a working actor in the
get more videos from me every single
or you're in the U.S or something like that
give you an opportunity to network and
end up getting a real audition and they
mobilizing the whole of your life from a
possessions means more fulfillment as we
know being able to offer you things and
of using the paintbrush does play an
is it actually legit to write off a car
through stocks and shares we would need
such as asana and notion that help you
something like that right a lot of times
Again link in the video description
for internet they normally present you
have you been doing everything that you
know maybe what they were doing or they
it but i got fairly close uh meaning i
in fact let's go max
which talks about how i developed
and try and get it right on the first draft
if your face is not seen on camera that
And so the word gamification
I've got my little fake plants
kind of a catch-22 of the industry a lot
questions or if there are any audition
wealth and it's to build money
emulate the actual questions on the
same we're using the three columns
and that just goes to show you that they
just free information on the Internet
pros of house hacking
get your first on-camera acting
fix and flips
payment that is pretty much just
can do
so when you book a role on a television
girl about her missing mother since the
download this crop we'll save it to the
if it's your first time here make sure
places you look for information from
If you write a book you publish a book
so in this video we're going to talk
having to spend much more time so the
it simple
"If this isn't nice I don't know what is,"
then later on you know once you've got
on tv shows too and sometimes in movies
also put it in the film section you
worse and i just don't recommend it for
people to help you this is when you can
when my eyes open and I'm still in bed
and i actually have a 12 off coupon for
tuberosity so your your pelvis just like

is because the states they have a
there's a lot more to it than just
the actual exam because this is where
I went to play football in basketball at

rich but seeing my parents still be so
deleted scenes on disney plus so if you
