hey guys in this video we are going over
the steps you need to take
in order to pass your real estate
license exam on the first try now as a
broker myself i have taken both the
salesperson and broker exams pass them
on the first try
and these are the tips tricks and study
that i found most useful when preparing
for my own exams if you're watching this
video then i assume that you have
already started taking your real estate
courses or you have just finished them
if not
make sure to check out this video which
i'll post below it shows you how you can
get your real estate license
in about 90 days and it's for sure the
fastest and cheapest way
that you can do it so in order to pass
the real estate exam
i think a lot of people think you need
to read every single word
on your course take notes and just be
the best student
possible while this certainly helps you
know like reading every word
will for sure help you on the test i
don't think it is
absolutely necessary to do that in fact
i don't think that is the smartest way
to spend
your time there's a lot of information
in the course that is
extra and you won't see on your actual
exam plus
most of that stuff will not show up in
real estate when you're actually working
as an agent
so if you find yourself getting burned
out from all the reading in your real
estate course
take it easy and just know that you can
skim some of the stuff
and still do extremely well on your
state exam
the last thing we want is for you to
burn out during the course or even worse
never finishing it because of all the
reading that there is guys
seriously just finish the course sort of
skim through the material and
the fun part begins when you start
studying for
the actual exam because this is where
what you study and how you study
really makes a difference so with that
being said let's get into the most
effective ways that you guys should be
to prepare for your state exam so the
first thing you want to do is read a
summary of your whole
real estate course this should take
maybe between 5 and 10 hours of your
if you're doing an online course for
example through real estate express
which is the course i recommend there
will be chapter summaries for you to go
if you did another type of online course
or you did an in-person course they
should also have some type of
summary for you to go over as well what
you want to do is you want to read each
of these summaries
take note of all the key vocabulary for
example words such as riparian rights or
eminent domain and really memorize the
words because those things will for sure
pop up on the state exam what we want to
do with this part of setting is refresh
your memory about the course i know
there's so much information
and that's why it's just important to go
through these more concise summaries
and try and remember all the important
stuff it'll help with making the
information stick in your brain and it
will also help you in the next part of
in fact the next phase of exam prep is
going to be way more effective once
you've read the summaries of
all the content by the way if you guys
are in california and you are looking
for a brokerage make sure to hit me up
because i have some free summaries that
i can send you these are the summaries
that i use to prepare for my own test so
i think it'll help you guys out a lot
and i'd also love to talk to you guys
about potentially joining my own
core capital realty i'll put something
about that in the description below okay
so the second phase of studying is
finding some type of exam preparation
the few weeks leading up to your exam
they are very important because this is
the time where you want to
immerse yourself with every possible
practice question that there is this is
basically what i did i skimmed through
my real estate courses
you know i did well on them but i didn't
you know focus 100
on them but instead i took that energy
and i put it all towards studying
my number one tip is to sign up for some
type of practice question bank this is
basically some type of service that
has a thousand or more questions that
emulate the actual questions on the
state exam i guarantee you that if you
over a thousand of these questions and
their answers and you understand the
reasoning for them
you will pass the test your first try
the one i recommend you guys try out is
real estate express because
you know just from past experience it's
the cheapest and it's the most efficient
possible to study it's definitely not
the only option but i do think that
it's going to give you the greatest
probability of passing on your first try
i find that they have accurate questions
which are very similar to the actual
state questions and they also have this
extremely good money back guarantee so
yeah they are quite confident that you
will pass if you go through all their
practice exams they also have custom
exams that are based on the topics that
you're struggling with
as well as flashcards for key terms and
topics so yeah overall an extremely
valuable tool to have the reason why you
need to do practice questions
is because the states they have a
certain way of asking questions it's not
going to be like
define riparian rights they'll find a
different way to ask and when you do
these types of practice questions you
get a really good sense on how they
format these questions
and yeah the way that they ask things
this is researchable and it's
practicable i don't know if that's real
word or not there are only a certain
number of things that the real estate
actually cares about and they tend to
recycle these questions and points
over and over again when you look at
simulation questions and their answers
you will basically
see every way that they ask things
because to be honest there's only a
finite number of ways that they can ask
the same question i guarantee you that
the same vocabulary the same topics and
the same concepts will show up on your
actual state exam so go through these
test main questions
one to two times and make sure you
absolutely know them reading the
summaries in
phase one setting will let you
understand why these answers are the
correct answer which will lead to better
now leading up to your test date you
want to consistently do practice
each and every day every day you need to
review these questions and you need to
review the content the last thing you
want to do is cram
12 hours of studying into the day before
you take the exam that's way worse than
three separate four hour study sessions
and why is that it's because
the more you cram the worse your
retention is now in summary there are
three main things that i went
over in this video first is don't read
every single word
on your actual course that's just the
wasted time second is
after you take the course make sure you
spend five to ten hours
reading these concise summaries of all
the course content
and the third thing is you have to sign
up for some type of practice question
service go through and memorize the
actual question and the answer for
at least a thousand of these questions
and i guarantee you the test is gonna be
very easy
you're gonna see duplicate questions and
you will pass on the first try the
biggest reason why people fail the test
is because they
simply did not take enough practice
questions and they also
spaced their prep too far apart the
moment that you finish
your actual course you take that final
exam and get your certificate
mail out your application to the
department of real estate so that you
can sign up for your exam depending on
your state this can take
up to one month to process for example
here in california it takes about
one month for them to actually receive
your application and
allow you to sign up for an exam date
during that month you need to study
consistently do about a couple hours per
day and then
one week before your actual exam start
doing four hours per day
get a good night's sleep eat some good
food stay hydrated and
go in confident it really is not a bad
test as long as you study effectively
and you study smart like how i said in
this video
you will do awesome i guarantee it so
