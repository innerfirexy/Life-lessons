let's say you're trying to get an agent
to help you pursue your acting career
some people think that getting an agent
is like getting a pizza you just
walk into the pizza shop order pizza and
they'll make it right there
so it's getting an agent like walking
into the agency's office asking for
representation and they'll sign you
right there on the spot
unfortunately it's not that simple
getting an agent is much more like
applying for admission to college and
not just any college a very selective
college that's
hard to get into like harvard for
instance every year thousands and
thousands of students apply for
admission to harvard and
every year only a very small percentage
of them like less than five percent get
similarly thousands and thousands of
actors submit themselves to talent
agencies and only a
very small percentage gets signed and
get representation
so what can you do to increase your
chances of being in that small
percentage that gets signed and gets
what exactly are those agents looking
for and what can you do to stand out
from the crowd
let's discuss
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television industry
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
spending some time here with me today
if this is your first time here make
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
more videos on acting
auditioning and career advice every
single week today we're talking about
how to get an agent for acting
specifically what exactly are agents
looking for and
what can you do to stand out from the
crowd to help you
get signed by an agent so let's get
right to it
agents are looking for people who are
serious about pursuing acting
who are willing to work as hard as they
can and willing to do
everything it takes to succeed agents
they're running a business and they're
trying to make money they don't have
time to waste on actors who are not
going to put in the work
and i know exactly what every single
actor is going to say every single actor
who submits to an agent is going to say
the same thing
they're going to say yes i'm going to
put in the work yes i'm willing to work
yes i really want to be an actor and i'm
serious about it and i'm really good and
and if you sign me you won't regret it
they're all going to say that so how do
they know who to pick
if everybody's saying the same thing how
can you stand out from the crowd
if everybody is telling them that here's
my suggestion
actions speak louder than words don't
tell them that you're going to work hard
show them don't tell them that you're
going to take this seriously
show them how well the best way to show
them that you
will take this seriously and that you
will work hard
is to prove to them that you already
have been taking this seriously
and that you already have been working
that's backing up your words with proof
so here are three ways to prove to them
that you are committed the first way to
prove to an agent that you're going to
take this seriously
is to take acting classes what better
way to show them that you are going to
work hard
than to actually be working hard in
acting classes
right now that's how you stand out from
the crowd that's how you show them that
you are committed to
working on your craft and becoming the
best actor that you can possibly be
my own agent has said that when she gets
a new actor submission
she looks at what classes they are
taking this is really
important we mentioned earlier that only
a very small percentage of actors who
submit to an agent actually end up
getting signed and getting
now i guarantee you that every single
one of those actors in that small
has been taking acting classes it is
that important
and there are so many different types of
classes that you can be taking to
improve yourself as an actor
technique classes improv scene study
voice and movement
accents and don't forget audition
classes if
you have an opportunity to take an
audition class i highly
highly recommend it because when you
submit to an agent and they're
they will very likely ask you to
audition for them so you better know
what you're doing when you're
you better be very skilled at
auditioning now if you're interested in
learning about how
i approach my own personal auditions the
10-step audition preparation process
that i use to make sure
every single audition is memorable then
i've created a free audition
cheat sheet that you can download by
going to that link right up there
or i put a link down in the description
so one more time make sure you are
taking acting classes
so that you will stand out when
submitting to an agent the second way to
prove to an agent that you are taking
this seriously
is to submit a professional headshot
look every single agent when you submit
to them they're going to ask for a
so you got to make sure your headshot is
a professional one
taken by a professional headshot
and yes i get it headshots cost money
they cost a lot of money they cost
sometimes two three four five hundred
dollars i know some actors that have
paid over a thousand dollars for
but guess what this is the cost of doing
business as an actor
this is no different than someone trying
to become an accountant
that person will need to take a
certification exam sometimes multiple
certification exams and those costs
hundreds of dollars sometimes over a
thousand dollars but that's what it
takes to become a professional
accountant and this
is what it takes to become a
professional actor you got to understand
that if you're trying to get an agent
that means you're trying to pursue
professionally so that's what you need
think about this
if you needed to see a doctor let's say
a specialist like a dermatologist and
you got two recommendations and one
doctor gives you their business card and
it's a real business card and it's got
their website and their phone number and
and the second doctor doesn't have a
card doesn't have a website
and all they did was they wrote their
phone number down on a back of a
mcdonald's receipt
which doctor are you going to take more
seriously which doctor are you going to
regard as more professional
now it may very well be that the
mcdonald's receipt guy
is the better doctor but professionalism
presentation matters your marketing
matters that shows people
how much you're taking your career
seriously and look even if you did
magically get signed to an agent without
a professional headshot you know what
they're going to tell you
immediately after signing you go get
professional headshots
because agents need a professional
headshot of you
to submit you to casting directors so
having a professional headshot not only
shows agents that
you are taking your career seriously but
it also shows them that you understand
how this industry works
and that a headshot is an actor's
business card and you
want your business card to stand out
from the crowd the third way to
show agents that you are serious about
this as your career is to have
credits on your resume now i know what
you're going to say how can i have
credits on my resume if i never had an
agent to help me get those credits
well i'm not talking about big hollywood
movie credits right now i'm talking
about the types of credits
that you can get on your own which are
student films
short films web series plays community
these types of things these types of
things still go
on your resume and they show that you
are taking initiative
it shows that you are working hard
towards your own career
because doing these things not only add
credits to your resume but they also can
give you an opportunity to network and
they could potentially add footage to
your demo reel
this is how you prove to an agent that
you are already working hard because the
truth is
you're still going to have to work just
as hard even after you do get an agent
an agent only makes a 10 commission off
of your union bookings that means
ninety percent of the work is still on
your shoulders in building your career
what's that ninety percent well that is
acting classes
that is your head shot in your resume
and all of your marketing materials that
is your networking
that's doing all the types of projects
that you can find on your own
all of that work is the 90 this is the
type of work that an
actor needs to be doing whether they
have an agent or not
and if you can show an agent that you
are already doing the work
then they will have more confidence in
you because you are standing out from
the crowd
and they will be more likely to sign you
so those were three ways to show an
agent that you are taking your career
the last thing i want to say on this
topic is that you could do all of those
things that we just talked about and
it's possible that an agent still
doesn't sign you and the reason is
is that there are certain factors that
are out of our control as actors
for instance it's possible that the
agent you're submitting to
simply isn't looking for someone in your
category at the moment
agents are trying to represent a diverse
roster of actors of all ages of all
ethnicities of all shapes and sizes
and it's possible that they simply have
too many people in your category at that
or they might be looking for just male
actors at the moment or just female
actress at the moment
these are things that are outside of our
control as actors
look it's difficult to get an agent it's
really hard we talked about it in the
it is a very very competitive industry
it's like trying to get admission to
so don't get down on yourself if you
don't get an agent right away
keep pushing forward and keep working
hard and eventually
the timing will work out for you there
is a little bit of luck to this
but like they say luck is when
opportunity meets preparation
and you never know when that opportunity
is going to come
so you better be prepared all the time
