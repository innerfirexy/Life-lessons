if you're thinking about starting an
acting career you might be wondering
how much does it cost to get started you
want to become an actor but you don't
know how much you should be paying who
you should be paying who's legitimate
who's a scam
so in this video we're going to talk
about the legitimate things that you
should be paying for when you're
starting an acting career
as well as a ballpark figure for how
much each of those things should cost
let's get started
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television industry
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
spending some time here with me today
if this is your first time here make
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
more videos on acting auditioning and
career advice
every single week today we're talking
about what the costs are to start an
acting career how much does it cost to
become an actor now
we're limiting today's conversation to
just the
startup costs so to speak how much it
costs in the first couple years as an
actor because
there are some other costs that veteran
actors will incur but we're
only talking today about what the
startup costs are in the first couple
now one more thing that i want to
mention is that some of the some of
these costs
may seem high to you um but you got to
remember that every single dime that you
put into your acting career
is an investment in yourself if you
truly believe
that you have what it takes to become an
actor then you believe that any money
that you're putting towards your career
will be paid off down the road so let's
start talking about what these things
are that you have to pay for to start
your career the first item
is training every single actor needs to
acting classes when they are starting
out now if you're still in high school
younger then i highly encourage you to
start taking classes that are offered in
your school whether they're drama club
classes or
school plays or anything where you can
get involved in acting in school because
those don't
cost anything extra for you i guarantee
you once you graduate high school there
are not going to be any more free acting
classes available
so if you are still in school definitely
take advantage of
the drama classes that are available
there if you've already graduated high
school then a lot of people ask whether
or not they should get a degree
if they should go to college and major
in acting
this is one option but it is certainly
not the only
option you can definitely go and get a
bachelor's and a master's degree
in acting from a college or a university
and that will cost anywhere between
twenty thousand dollars to
over a hundred thousand dollars
depending on what school you go to
if you have aspirations of becoming a
musical theater actor
if you want to become an actor on
then a theater degree can be very
beneficial it may even be required i'm
not 100
sure on that because i'm not a theater
actor but i can tell you
that in the film and television world a
theater degree can be helpful but it
certainly is not required
nobody in this industry cares if you
have a degree they only care if you are
a good actor
whether or not you got that from college
or if you got that from learning in a
private studio
nobody cares they only care that you can
act so that leads me to acting studios
instead of getting a degree in acting
you can just take classes at a private
acting studio
this is how i've been taking acting
classes my entire 12-year acting career
so an acting studio you can expect to
pay classes pay for classes
they will range between probably a
hundred dollars to three hundred dollars
per month
depending on where the acting studio is
in smaller markets it can be on the
cheaper side in bigger markets and can
cost a little bit more
in hollywood there are some well-known
acting teachers that charge
500 600 or more per month but
most acting classes are not quite that
all of my acting classes that i've taken
have always been
roughly one to three hundred dollars per
now if that isn't within your budget if
you can't afford to pay that much there
are ways where you can actually get
classes for cheaper than that
and that is that you can offer to work
at the acting studio
in exchange for discounted classes you
can offer
to be the teacher's assistant or to be
an administrative assistant
and get cheaper classes that way i know
plenty of actors that have done that and
gotten discounted classes or even free
classes sometimes and the last thing
i'll say about acting classes
is beware of anybody who says that they
can make you famous
nobody can teach you how to become
famous that is not something
that anyone can promise you if they do
are for sure a scam so run the other way
how can you tell if an acting class is
legitimate well
a lot of classes will allow you to audit
a class for free
so i encourage you to sit in on class
and check out and see if
the acting teacher and the students
there are some people that you'd like to
work with
the next thing that every actor will
need to spend money on is head shots
headshots are the actors business card
it is the sign
in front of their store it is the
biggest marketing tool that every actor
will have
for their career so it is important that
you do
invest in this you shouldn't try to find
the cheapest headshot photographer you
should really try to find the best
headshot photographer
and then see if that works within your
budget so
it's important to go to a professional
here and not just try to take a good
picture with your iphone
or find your uncle with a fancy camera
to try to take pictures
for you it's it's really important to
try to get a professional headshot a
professional headshot can cost
somewhere between 200 to 600.
uh depending on what market you're in a
smaller market might cost a little bit
less a bigger market might cost a little
bit more
i do know actors that have spent over a
thousand dollars for headshots
and that just goes to show you that they
are taking their career seriously
they're willing to
invest in it because a headshot is so
important for an actor
because look you have to be able to
stand out when you're submitted among
thousands of other actors
when your headshot goes to a casting
director and if your headshot does not
look professional that speaks to how
you are taking your career now i know
that two to six hundred dollars might be
a lot to pay for some people and there
are ways that you could potentially save
and that is to maybe go to a photography
someone who does know what they are
doing photography wise but
may not be a professional yet you could
go to a photography student they may
charge you a lot less than a pro
the risk that you're taking there is
that their head shots may not turn out
that well
and you've just wasted that money and
then you have to go to a professional
but if you're willing to take that risk
that might be a way that you can kind of
save a little bit of money
with head shots the next thing that
you'll have to pay for as an actor
starting out is casting websites
here in north america the most commonly
used casting websites are actors access
casting networks and backstage if you
live outside of north america
then there are probably other casting
websites that are used so you'll have to
research those on your own but as far as
these three go
actors access you can actually get an
account for free
but you will have to pay every single
time that you submit for
an audition you can also pay for a 68
annual fee for actors access
which will waive all of the individual
fees every time that you
submit for an audition uh casting
networks cost 25
a year but they waive that fee if you
sign up through an agent so if you have
an agent you don't have to pay for
casting networks
and then backstage i believe costs 150 a
i don't have backstage because it is not
really used so much
here in the atlanta area but if you live
in the los angeles or new york markets
it is probably much more common for
actors to have a backstage account
now one more website that is very
commonly used for actors
not for casting purposes but for kind of
marketing purposes and exposure purposes
is imdb
an imdb pro account costs 150
a year but when you are first starting
out i don't recommend signing up for it
you don't need that right away i think
once you have a couple
credits that will go on imdb with your
then you can sign up for an imdb pro
account and then you can put your
picture out there
and link people to it and everything
like that speaking of websites i do want
to mention my own website
actingcareercenter.com now this is not a
casting website so don't expect to see
auditions there
but i do have some free resources
available to you
including my free audition cheat sheet
which is my 10-step audition preparation
process that i use for my own auditions
if you want to download my free audition
cheat sheet you can go to it by clicking
that link right up there
or by going to the link in the
description below the next thing that
every actor can expect to spend some
money on
is self-taping equipment the world of
auditions has moved heavily towards
self-taping in recent years so
investing in self-taping equipment is
absolutely essential for modern day
actors now the great thing is that we
all have hd cameras in our phones these
days so you definitely don't have to go
out and buy a fancy camera for taping
auditions at home
you can invest as little as a hundred
dollars with just a tripod
and a couple lights while recording your
auditions with your phone
and that can be a really good
self-taping setup for home
the other option would be to go to a
taping service every time you
get an audition now audition taping
services are probably
not in every single city especially in
the small markets but in the major
markets like los angeles
uh chicago new york atlanta and some of
the mid markets will probably all have
some taping services that will
record your audition for you edit it and
send it off for a fee
usually between twenty dollars and sixty
dollars per audition
now that's going to be up to you whether
or not you want to pay the fee every
single time that you have an audition
or to invest in the self-taping setup at
home for yourself
now another option to kind of save some
money for yourself tapes is to find a
friend who has a self-taping setup
and offer to be their reader every time
they have an audition
in exchange for having them tape your
every single time that you have one and
just do kind of an
audition exchange i've done that for
many of my friends and i know plenty of
other actors that have done that as well
to kind of save a little bit of money
for their self taping now if you want to
learn more about self-taping i actually
have another resource on my website
which is a
page dedicated specifically to all the
tools that i recommend
for taping your auditions at home i'll
put a link to that resource list
down in the description below the next
thing you can expect to pay for
is demo reel editing now when you first
start out as an actor you don't have a
demo reel and you don't have anything to
make a demo reel with
but as you've done a little bit of work
let's say you did a short film or a
student film or a web series and you
have a couple
scenes of footage then you will need to
be able to create a demo reel from that
and unless you are already a proficient
video editor
then you'll probably have to pay someone
to create your demo reel for you
now this can cost anywhere between i'd
say fifty dollars to two hundred dollars
i wouldn't expect to pay more than two
hundred dollars especially
when you're first starting out when you
are much later in your career and you
have many many scenes that you're trying
to create and
uh fit into a demo reel then you may end
up paying more
but when you're first starting out i'd
expect to pay probably not much more
than a hundred dollars
to create a demo reel once you get to
the point in your career where you're
getting representation whether that's an
agent or a manager or both then you can
expect some of your money to go to them
now agents and managers do cost money
but they don't
cost money up front that's one thing
that you should really
keep in mind because anybody that asks
for money from you
up front for representation is a
complete scam
so avoid them at all costs agents and
managers make their money
off of commission so they charge a
commission off
any money that you make as an actor here
in the united states agents make a 10
commission off of all union jobs sag
after jobs and anywhere between 15 and
20 percent on non-union jobs
managers also make anywhere between a 10
and 20 commission off of all of your
jobs so
that means if you have both an agent and
a manager
you're paying anywhere between 20 and up
40 percent of your paycheck to them just
off of commission
so just be aware of that and be ready
for that
once you do get representation now
another thing that you won't have to
worry about
right from the beginning but it should
be something that you should think about
in the future is uh the cost of joining
the union so here in north america the
film and television actors union is sag
aftra and the cost for joining the union
at least in 2020
is three thousand dollars now whether or
not you should join the union and when
you should join the union
is a topic for another day that's a
whole other conversation
but just know that if you decide to join
the union you should expect to pay
up to three thousand dollars now the
reason why i say up to three thousand
is that depending on what market you're
in you may pay
less than that so if you are in the
major markets like new york or los
it does cost three thousand dollars the
initiation fee to join the union
but in smaller markets like atlanta
atlanta's initiation fee
to join sag-aftra is only about half of
that so when i joined the union here in
i didn't pay the full 3000. i paid about
half but if i were to book a job
in new york or los angeles i would have
to pay the difference so it's not like
i'm getting a really good deal here or
anything this next one is kind of an
indirect cost for an acting career and
that is relocation costs when you move
to a new market
most actors don't start out living in
one of the major
film and television production markets
like new york or la or atlanta
most actors start out living in some
smaller market and then at some point in
their careers they decide they want to
move to one of the bigger markets this
is what i did in 2016. i moved from
cleveland ohio to atlanta georgia now
relocating costs money the moving costs
and the money that you should have saved
up to move to a new city
i highly highly encourage anyone who is
thinking about moving
to a new city to pursue acting to have
plenty of money saved up when they move
now if you're trying to move to new york
or l.a one of the major markets
understand that these cities have really
high costs of living so you should
really have
i think at least 10 000 saved up in the
bank account if you want to move to one
of these major markets
if you want to move to a market like
atlanta which doesn't quite
doesn't cost quite as much as new york
or la then you could probably get by
with saving
five to six thousand dollars before you
move to this city
but no matter where you move understand
that it will cost money
and you should have that money saved up
when you go because you don't want to be
one of those actors who gets to the new
blows through all their savings in a
month or two and then has to move back
home and now you've wasted all that
money and all that time
you want to make sure that when you go
you're in it for the long haul
so those were all of the costs that i
can think of for new actors who are
trying to start an
acting career there are some other costs
that you will probably have to think
about when you are further along in your
like the cost of incorporating if you
want to do that
uh if you want to get an entertainment
lawyer or a publicist
all of those things cost money as well
but you probably don't have to think
about things
those things for quite a while and you
can just focus on what we've talked
about today
now there's one more cost that i do want
to mention and this is an important one
i think that the real cost of trying to
start an acting career
is not monetary the real cost
comes in the form of the sacrifices that
need to be made in order to pursue this
the time that it takes the
stability that you're sacrificing
financial stability and
life stability the lack of vacations
that you can take
the uh social life that you'll have to
um the opportunity cost of potentially
pursuing a different career
all of these things are sacrifices that
you're to have to make in terms of your
the time is a big thing because when
you're trying to pursue an acting career
you're putting a full-time effort
into this career but oftentimes most
the vast majority of actors are also
aside jobs sometimes multiple side jobs
in order to support their acting career
so we are spending much more than just
like a traditional 40-hour work week on
our careers
you you'll see a lot of your friends
that may have gone the traditional
career route and
they work a 40-hour work week and they
get a steady paycheck
and they get paid time off and they're
able to go on vacations
you're gonna have to accept that you may
not be able to do those things
when you pursue an acting career and
those are the sacrifices that
we have to make as actors you got to be
committed to this
you gotta really love the craft
of acting and not just be in love with
the idea of becoming rich and famous
because if that's what you love then
the sacrifices are not going to be worth
it to you
if those sacrifices are worth it to you
if you're willing to do all those things
if you're willing to do all of that for
your career because
this is what you really want and you
can't see yourself doing anything else
then let me tell you this i think there
are so many other aspects of this career
that are extremely rewarding
and in my opinion far outweigh those
monetary costs
and those sacrifices that have to be
made all right that's it for today
