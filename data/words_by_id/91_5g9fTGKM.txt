what's up my fellow actors kurt you here
from actingcareercenter.com
i'm doing another hotel room video today
because i am currently out of town
working on a television show
and i wanted to share a story from
working on set yesterday that i think is
a good lesson
for a lot of newer actors so um i had a
yesterday with a couple other actors and
i played a doctor which i tend to a lot
and then there was a patient and a nurse
in the scene
and in our scene you know all of the
actors we individually
kind of prepared for the scene
beforehand right we worked on our lines
and you know we
uh did all of our prep work before going
on set but then
once we arrived on set and this happens
quite a bit
uh they end up changing things around
they ended up
adding a couple lines uh they added a
line for the patient a question and then
they added a line for me the doctor to
uh respond and then they ended up
changing a couple lines too some of the
lines that were already in the script
they wanted
uh the patient to say something
different and then they wanted the
doctor to say something different
so they they they changed uh quite a bit
in this scene on set while we were there
and this doesn't happen in every scene
but it happens enough where actors need
to be prepared for it
i think this is where experience really
does come into play
because when they did come in and the
comes in and asks us to add this line
and then add this line and then
change this line and then change this
other line none of the actors in the
baton and i we were all locked in said
all right
okay got it let's do it and then we did
the scene again and everybody did it
all the new way um i should also point
they also added different blocking and
what blocking is is the movement that
you have in the scene
so originally they wanted me as the
doctor to walk in and then
reference the the patient's chart and
talk about uh
what's going on but then when they
change the lines and they change the
scene they said okay now why don't you
set the chart down and then
walk over and just address the patient
all of this ends up happening in the
middle of the scene while we are doing
and this is where an inexperienced actor
might get overwhelmed by what was going
on an inexperienced actor might say oh
my gosh you're asking me to
remember this new line and then also
remember to change to this other line
and also
do all of these things that i had never
rehearsed i was also told i needed to
pull out a pad and paper and start
writing in the middle of it
so um the point is is that
having that experience both myself and
the other actors in the scene having
that experience
led us to making that scene run very
and this goes back to the points that
i've made in
a lot of my previous videos of making
sure you
have you have proper training you know
getting that experience
learning and acting class where you can
make those mistakes so that when you get
on set
you don't have because you don't have
time to make a ton of mistakes on set
right so you make your mistakes and act
in class so that when you get on set
you're ready to perform
and also you know getting that
experience working on
working in plays working in student
films and short films and
low budget indie films where the stakes
are lower where the pressure is lower
so that you understand exactly how
things will happen on set because
those type of things happen in those
smaller projects too
so once you've got that experience under
your belt when you go on to a bigger
a multi-million dollar project when the
pressure is higher
you're not going to make those same
mistakes because you've made them before
and you're ready for it and you're
prepared for it and you understand that
you know the unexpected things might
happen another thing that i should
is that the actor who played my patient
he was an a-list celebrity
he was someone that everybody knew now
again if someone is inexperienced
that could throw them off right then and
there working with an a-list celebrity
in a scene
but uh because everybody was experienced
and knew what they were doing the scene
went smoothly even though they had so
many changes
as we were doing things you know a lot
of actors say that they want to act in a
big netflix show or a big marvel movie
or a star wars movie
and that's the first thing that they ask
for and i don't think that's a great
you don't want your first ever acting
experience to be on a
big budget 100 million dollar project
because the pressure is going to be
so high you're going to have all these
big lights on you
giant cameras in your face in front of a
they're going to be changing lines
they're going to be asking you to do all
these things you're gonna get
so that's why you gotta have experience
before getting onto a big
project like that you know working like
i said working in class
working on lower budget projects where
you're being paid nothing or you're
being paid like 50 bucks or 100 bucks to
gain that
all of those things that you you can
learn before you get on to a higher
stress situation like a big budget
project all right that's it for today's
video if you enjoyed it please give it a
thumbs up

and until next time keep practicing keep
learning and i hope to see you on set
one day
