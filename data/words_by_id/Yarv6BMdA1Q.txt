if you're an actor and you don't have an
agent you may be wondering
how and where to find auditions well in
this video i'm going to show you
four ways to get auditions without an
agent and we're not talking about being
extra we're talking about auditions for
speaking roles
so if this is something that you're
interested in let's get started right
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television industry
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
spending some time here with me today
if this is your first time here make
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
more videos on acting
auditioning and career advice every
single week
in this video we're going to be talking
about how to find auditions without an
agent and not just one way
four different ways to get auditions
without an agent and even when you do
get an agent in the future
you can continue to use these strategies
to get even more auditions than what
your agent will be sending you
i still use some of these methods myself
now you can use these methods to find
auditions for all kinds of opportunities
including movies and tv shows
and commercials and theater in fact let
me know down in the comments which one
you are most interested in is it movies
is it television is it commercials or
theater i'd love to know what your
acting goals are
all right let's talk about these four
different ways to find auditions without
an agent
the first way is to look in your local
acting facebook groups
did you know that just about every major
has a facebook group or multiple
facebook groups
dedicated to actors and filmmaking all
you have to do is go on to facebook and
search for your city plus the word
actors or
filmmaking so for example let's say you
live in kansas city
people in kansas city right now are like
how did you know you sorcerer so let's
say you live in kansas city you would go
onto facebook and you would search for
kansas city
actors and then you would tell facebook
that you are searching for groups
and then the results will be all the
groups associated with acting and
in kansas city now if you live in a
small town you may not be able to find
facebook groups for your particular town
and in those cases i would recommend
searching for the nearest big city
or for your state so once you join these
groups you can start looking for
audition opportunities or
casting calls in your area now another
huge benefit to being in these
local facebook groups is that you can
get information
about your specific city a lot of people
will ask me on this youtube channel hey
what's the best agent in phoenix or who
are the best acting teachers in
unfortunately i can't answer those
questions because i've never lived in
those locations
but if you're in one of these local
facebook groups the people there can
probably answer
those types of questions for you so
search for those groups
join them introduce yourself and keep an
eye out for casting calls and audition
opportunities in your area
the second way to find auditions without
an agent is to follow agents and casting
directors on social media follow them on
twitter on facebook on instagram
wherever you can find them just follow
them now the goal here isn't to follow
them and then dm them all the time about
hey give me some auditions
no all you have to do is follow them and
then watch for what they are posting
because every once in a while agents and
casting directors will be having trouble
finding the right actor to fill a
specific role for a project
and in those instances they will post
publicly on social media
searching for the actors making it
basically a public casting call now this
doesn't happen every day or even every
week but i would say
once or twice a month i see agents and
casting directors posting things like
on social media a lot of times they'll
be looking for someone who has a
specific skill like someone who can
backflip on a snowboard or someone who
can play mozart on the violin
or they'll be looking for a very
specific type like people over seven
feet tall
or people with neck tattoos or people
who like to wear purple suits and have a
tiny dog
so if you happen to have the skill or
the characteristic that they are
looking for then now is your opportunity
to submit for this audition
if you're getting value out of this
video then do me a favor and give it a
thumbs up
now before we move on to the last two
ways to find auditions without an
agent let me remind you that when you do
get an audition you better know how to
prepare for it and how to deliver a
memorable performance
now if you're interested in learning
about how i prepare for my auditions
then i've created a free audition cheat
sheet that's basically the 10 step
audition preparation process that i
use personally for my auditions you can
download the free cheat sheet by going
to that link
right there the third way to find
auditions without an agent is to browse
public casting websites now in north
america the three most commonly used
casting websites are actors access
casting networks and backstage if you
live outside of north america
i don't know what cast and websites are
used in every other country so you'll
have to do your own
research a great place to ask that
question is to use those facebook groups
that we talked about
you can also ask other actors and your
acting teachers what are the websites
are used in your region as for actors
access casting networks and backstage
these three websites have their
differences for sure but in general
they all allow you to do the same thing
which is
create a casting profile including your
headshot and your information
and then start browsing the public
casting boards for roles that fit you
you can even create email notifications
so that you'll be sent an email
every time a new role is posted that
fits you
specifically i've put links to all three
of these websites down in the
the fourth way to find auditions without
an agent is to attend casting director
workshops and classes
many casting directors will hold
workshops and classes to teach actors
about the audition process
and the skills they need to stand out in
the audition room
many of these workshops will give the
attendees the opportunity to perform a
mock audition for the casting director
and get feedback
now if you do a great job with this mock
audition and the casting director is
impressed by your work in the class
they might make a mental note and the
next time that they get a role that fits
they could call you in for an audition
even though you don't have an agent
i know many actors who have gotten
auditions in this way
so if you are already following casting
directors on social media like we talked
about before
then also keep an eye out for when they
might be having classes or workshops
okay those were my tips on how to find
auditions without an
agent now the last thing i want to
mention is that the vast majority of
auditions are self-taped these days
which means casting directors will ask
to record your auditions at home and
then send it to them
now if you're interested in learning how
to self-tape auditions at home
i've created multiple videos about that
topic that you can watch
by going to that playlist right there
all right if you like this video please

comment down below if you have
any questions alright until next time
keep practicing keep learning and i hope
to see you
on set one day
