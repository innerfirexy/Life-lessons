if you want to be cast in a movie or a
television show it's really important to
exactly how the casting process works
because the audition is not the only
step in the process
as actors we really only know about the
audition because it's the only step that
we are directly involved in right
but there are steps before and after the
audition that are just as significant
and if you don't understand how those
steps affect you
you could be sabotaging your own chances
of getting booked
so today let's talk about exactly how
the entire casting process works
what's up my fellow actors welcome to

a shout out i'd really appreciate it
all right enough about cobra kai let's
talk about today's topic which is how
the casting process
works i'm going to give you a kind of a
high level
overview of the casting process there
are specific
details that are different from case to
case from
project to project so i'm not gonna go
into the weeds of all that but i will
give you kind of a bird's-eye view
of how in general the casting process
works for a movie
or a television show i'll break down the
steps that it takes to cast a role in a
movie or a show
and how your audition kind of fits into
those steps okay so let's start with an
example let's say there's a new movie
that's going to be made
uh let say a disney movie once that
is done being written once the writers
have finished writing the script
they now need to cast the movie right so
the producers now
need to hire a casting director this is
step one
the producers of the movie hire a
casting director
to help them cast the movie the casting
director then takes that script
and they will go through it and find
every single role that needs to be cast
and create breakdowns for those roles a
is just the short description of each
inside the script and then step two is
that the casting director will then
send those breakdowns out to agents
sometimes those breakdowns will be sent
publicly posted publicly as well on
sites like actors access
so that uh individual actors can access
but most of the time for big budget
movies and television shows
they go directly to agents and will not
be posted publicly i would say 95
of the time or more breakdowns only go
to agents and will not be posted
publicly so that actors cannot access
directly that's why it is so important
that an actor
get an agent at some point in their
all right now that the agent has the
breakdowns they will then take those
breakdowns and compare it to their
of all the actors they represent and see
fits each role so for simplicity's sake
our example let's only focus on one
particular role because
a full movie script can have 50 or more
roles that need to be cast from the
lead all the way down to all the
supporting roles but let's just focus on
one role for simplicity let's say
there's a role for
a a person that works at a coffee shop
the description is ages 16 to 25
male or female so that's the character
breakdown so if i'm an agent i get that
character breakdown i then look at my
roster of all the actors i represent and
i say hey
here are all the people that fit that
breakdown okay and once i find that
group of people
all of those actors that fit the
breakdown i then send the headshot
resume and demo reel of all of those
back to the casting director and say hey
casting director
here are all of the actors that i
represent that fit
this character okay so we're not
involving the actors yet this is
only communication between the casting
and the agent so far so that was step
three the agent
now sending all of the actors they
back to the casting director for a
particular role
now that the casting director has
received all of those headshots resumes
and demo reels
they now look at all of these actors and
which ones they would like to see
audition now in an ideal world
every single actor would get a chance to
audition but
unfortunately in the real world there
isn't that much time available that's
the main problem the casting director
does not have enough time to audition
every single actor that wants to
because think about it we're only
talking about one agent here
typically a casting director will reach
out to dozens of agents
so if dozens of agents all send all of
their actors that fit this particular
coffee shop
worker role the casting director could
potentially get a submission of
hundreds or even thousands of actor
there's no way that the casting director
can audition
hundreds or thousands of people for that
one role
because remember there are 50 other
roles that need to be cast for this
right so for this particular role they
might only be able to see
20 or 30 actors that means for each
agency that submitted they might only be
able to audition
one actor or two actors per each
agency this is why it is so important to
have a great
head shot because in this step of the
how are you going to stand out to a
casting director
the casting director is looking at a sea
of hundreds of head shots
and they have to decide and pick 20 or
30 out of all of those
of those people that they want to see
audition so you have to have a headshot
that really catches their eye
and really stands out for them to decide
oh i want to see this person audition
so that is step four step four is the
casting director
selecting which actors they would like
to see audition
and then telling that to the agent
saying hey agent
thank you for sending me all of these
actors that fit this role
here are the two actors i would like to
see audition please
moving on to step five step five is now
the agent now passing that information
along to the actor
now finally the actor comes into play
the agent will then tell the actor hey
you got an audition and here are the
step six is then the actor preparing for
the audition and this is the part that
we are all familiar with
as actors now we finally have the
audition sides we have the role that we
need to audition for
and now we have time to get ready for
the audition
in my experience typically you have
between 24 and 48 hours to prepare for
an audition
occasionally i will have more than 48
maybe uh an extra day but
very very rarely will i have more than
four days to prepare for an audition i
would say on
average it's about 48 hours now you
might be asking
how can you prepare a really really
great audition in less than 48 hours
well i'm glad you asked i've actually
created a free
10-step audition preparation cheat sheet
that will help you
nail your audition every single time so
if you want to download that free cheat
sheet you can get it by going to that
right up there now that you've prepared
your audition
step seven is actually doing the
the audition can be live and in person
what's a little bit more common these
days is doing a self tape which is
recording your audition at home
and then sending it electronically to
the casting director
step 8 is the casting director reviewing
every single
audition from each of the actors if they
were in-person auditions
they would have all been recorded in the
room so the casting director will watch
all of those auditions back again
or if they were self taped the casting
director will just watch
all of those tapes at this point there
or could not be callbacks depending on
the project and depending on the role
a callback is when a casting director
then brings back
some of the actors that they really
liked for that particular role
to give them a second round of auditions
if an actor gets a call back that means
they are really interested in them for
the role
they've they've been brought back not
everybody gets
brought back for a callback they usually
only bring back the people that they are
interested in now some auditions don't
have callbacks sometimes they will
just book the actor off of the initial
some will have one round of callbacks
some others will have
even more than one brown some will have
producer sessions and network tests and
all kinds of stuff
so that's why i say step nine here is
that there might be call backs there
might not be but just understand what
are in this process after the callbacks
the casting director will then make
their recommendations for each role of
the project to the producers so that is
step 10
the casting director recommending their
top three or top five
actors for each role to the producers
for a final casting decision
step 11 the final casting decision now
needs to be made
it's important to understand that the
casting director does not make
the final casting decision they may have
but they are not the final decision
for a television show the final decision
makers are the producers the show runner
and the network for a movie
it's usually the producers and the
director but the important thing
is that it is not the casting director
the casting director does have an
important role
in the beginning of the process because
they select who they want to see
audition so in a way they do decide who
has a
chance of booking the part but when it
comes to the very end
they don't make that final decision so
that was step 11. step 12
is once that final decision is made the
casting director
then extends an offer to the agent of
that actor
and then step 13 is the final step the
agent then
passes along that offer to the actor and
hey actor you have just booked the role
coffee shop worker on this new disney
movie all right that was a peek behind
the curtain of how this whole casting
process works
i hope this clears things up a little
bit if you had any confusion about how
this process works
