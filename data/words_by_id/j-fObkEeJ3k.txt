hey guys so you clicked on this video
because you're thinking about investing
in real estate
in this video i'm going over seven
different things that you need to know
before buying your first
investment or rental property if you
follow these steps i guarantee you'll
one better results financially two less
stress and three know how to leverage
real estate
in the right ways so let's get started
first up is knowing your financing
options there are many different ways to
buy rental property you can use cash you
can use traditional financing you can
use a hard money loan and there are many
other options too before buying
understand what your options are and
what works best
for you first things first you need to
have steady employment or if you're
self-employed you need to have tax
returns for the last two years
if you don't have this stuff it's going
to be very difficult to buy unless you
all cash or you're buying under market
value and renovating it now if you're
going to live at the house you can
actually put down as low as three to
five percent
as well as get the best rate possible
this is called house hacking and i
definitely recommend this for all
you basically live in one of the units
or in one of the rooms and rent out the
other rooms or other units now if you're
not living there you'll probably have to
put down at least 25 percent and it
really depends on the lender that you go
with i definitely recommend
going with a 30-year fixed because the
rates are super low right now when
shopping for your loan
make sure to rate shop with different
lenders or mortgage brokers that way you
can get the lowest rate possible it's
good to be prepared because without the
right financing
most people are not going to be able to
buy a rental it affects your cash flow
and it also affects whether or not it's
a good
leveraged investment the second thing
you guys need to know is how to increase
the value of the home
there are so many different things that
you guys can do to increase the value
and i'll define what that is right now
it's basically when you're getting a
positive return on your investment let's
say you're spending x dollars and
putting it into the house and when you
spend those x dollars you're going to
get y dollars of equity if y is greater
than x then that is a good
roi before buying you need to know what
value adding things
to look for this increases your chance
of actually finding value at properties
you can definitely build
instant equity by buying certain
fixer-uppers and doing some of these
minor cosmetic fixes for example you can
do your paint
you can change out the floors with lvp
painting some cabinets doing some
landscaping working on the bathrooms
all these things tend to have a positive
roi i definitely recommend assessing the
area that the house is in because you
don't want to over renovate ideally
you'll want it at the median level of
improvement for that neighborhood and
yeah just don't be afraid to buy
properties that need a little bit of
work it's actually really quite simple
if you're doing a lot of cosmetic stuff
now i did this with my first
property i knew that the renovations
could pretty easily be done
so i wasn't afraid to expand my search
and not only look for
turnkey properties third is you must
have an emergency fund
you absolutely do not want to spend
every single penny that you have
on your down payment there are a ton of
other costs associated with holding
rental properties that you guys might
not account for
one is unexpected vacancies can you
actually make your mortgage payments if
it takes you longer than expected to
find a tenant
or what happens if there are any
unexpected repairs for example what if
you need a new roof
a new water heater the ac or heater
needs to be fixed or there's like a
major leak in the house that's why a
home inspection is so
important during escrow and that's why
running the numbers is so important too
i recommend just have some of these
funds ready just in case something
happens and
don't have anything less than ten
thousand dollars in the bank
after your purchase this number goes up
if you buy more expensive and bigger
properties and yeah it's just really
good to have a safety net because
real estate investing it's already a
little bit more risky so you definitely
need to be aware of any unexpected costs
the third thing you guys have to know is
all the amazing tax benefits that come
with holding rental properties i just
want you guys to know how important
buying these rental properties is for
saving on taxes
and building wealth it's really both the
short-term and the long-term strategy
for building
generational wealth you can have cash
flow and you can also have massive tax
deductions the real secret sauce with
holding rental properties is that it
allows you to take
huge depreciations and actually lose
money on paper you're not actually
losing real money
you're losing phantom money here's how
it works basically let's say you guys
have a five hundred thousand dollar
property three hundred thousand dollars
of that property is its building value
and two hundred thousand dollars
is the land now what we can do is we can
do a cost segregation which is basically
an accelerated depreciation on that
three thousand dollars you'll go through
and analyze what things you can write
out faster
because normally for investment
properties you're supposed to depreciate
it for 29.5
years however lots of things in the home
won't last that long and in that case
you can depreciate them on an
accelerated schedule
for example the cabinets the fridge the
roof all these things are going to not
last 29.5 years so let's say on that 500
house you can depreciate 50 000 in the
first year
however your net rental income after
expenses is 30 000
this means you're taking a 20 000 loss
on paper and if you're an active
investor or a real estate professional
you can use that loss to offset other
income yes this will reduce your cost
basis but you can just keep 1031
and really never pay taxes on any of the
gains i could talk about this for
probably one hour but i just really
wanted to simplify it because
understanding this concept is really
important just know that there's a huge
advantage to owning investment
properties and in some cases you should
definitely be utilizing these
depreciation schedules next up is that
the right location matters
your location of your property
determines so many different things for
example the types of tents you
get your future appreciation the price
how you manage and
a lot of other things i say for most
people for your first rental
try and buy in your area if you can if
you're in a high cost of living area
then it's definitely okay to venture
elsewhere just know that it affects how
hands-on you can get i know a lot of
people my age who are looking out of
state to buy rental properties now if
you are looking at a state i definitely
recommend trying to get multi-units
instead of single-family residences
these normally have a better return and
if you're going through the hassle of
investing out of state
you might as well buy more units if you
can for the location you really need to
do research about the population trends
the local economy price the rent ratios
and the potential growth the goal is to
really get appreciation
on our side for example people who
invested in the bay area early or even
la new york or seattle they saw huge
gains with prices nearly doubling over
10 years
make sure that the city you're investing
in is on the uptrend
because while there are many cities that
can cash flow the housing prices are
pretty stagnant and you're really
missing out on those huge gains of
appreciation okay next up is you need to
know how to run the numbers so why do we
invest in real estate well it's to build
wealth and it's to build money
it's really important to know the
numbers for any deal that you're
considering this will affect the risk
of the investment as well as how much
you can make from it so you can really
compare buying it with other properties
and other types of investments because
really real estate is not the only thing
that you guys can invest your money in
you can choose individual stocks
collectibles index funds bitcoin so many
others so now i'm going to take you guys
through this residential income
calculator so a tool like this is
absolutely essential when you're trying
to see if a
place is worth it to buy or not because
it lets you put in a ton of different
metrics and it will actually calculate
to see if it's going to be a good
investment property so here you can see
we can put in the purchase price
uh your down payment amount it'll also
let us change the mortgage info so you
can see
in 30 years which is what you'll
probably do your interest rate
is way too high we'll start with three
it'll calculate your monthly loan
payment and you can actually just
estimate your
closing costs by running something here
you can change all these different
things the
vacancy rate the number of units your
annual operating expenses so these are
all things that are going to cost you
money to maintain the place
and what this calculator is going to do
is it's going to calculate a bunch of
uh key ratios that you guys need to look
at for example the cap rate right here
and the cash on cash return right here
there are a lot of other metrics that
you guys can use but those are the two
main ones that i like to look at
and there are a lot of calculators out
there for free but the whole point is
just to
find your projected net operating income
which allows you to calculate your cap
rate as well as your cash on cash return
this lets you compare between different
and as you buy more and more properties
you'll have a standard or
minimum for these numbers that you want
to hit the next thing that's super super
important is to get
a quality tenant the difference between
a good and a bad tenant is
mind-blowing when you buy a rental that
means that you're going to be a landlord
and this comes with a lot of stress
that is unless you find a good tenant
you can either find a tenant yourself
or you can hire a property manager to do
so usually they'll take about one month
of rent
as their fee now if you're doing it
yourself you can use zillow rental
manager you can use craigslist and you
can also post to social media posting on
zillow will actually syndicate it with a
bunch of sites like hotpads and trulia
and i only recommend doing it yourself
if you're local otherwise i definitely
say hire someone it's really important
for someone that you trust to
meet that potential tenant face to face
and definitely just don't rent it
quickly to the first person who applies
unless they are super super good you
just really have to do your due
the top concerns that landlords have are
payment problems eviction and criminal
fake information high maintenance and
just them moving a lot you absolutely
have to do a full tent screening look at
their credit and look at their eviction
history their character also matters a
lot are they going to be demanding
are they going to take care of the
property do they have good ethics it's
just very important to get good at this
and understand the importance before
finding your first tenant and the same
goes for all future tenants too this
will make real estate investing a much
better experience for you anyways i hope
