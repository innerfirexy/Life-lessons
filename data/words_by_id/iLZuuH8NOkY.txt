hey you guys and welcome back to my
channel today
we're going to chat all about how to
know when you should go full time
in your small business i feel like this
is a huge question that so many people
because you probably start your business
as a side hustle while working a
full-time job
you're trying to figure out when you
should make the switch and when you
should go full time in your business so
we're going to talk a little bit today
about my thoughts on that and when you
should go full time and all of that so
in full transparency i do want you guys
to know that i went full time my
um straight out of college so i kind of
had the goal when i started my business
my senior year of high school
that when i graduated college four years
later that i'd be able to go full time
with it and to be honest i probably
could have gone full time about halfway
through college
and i almost quit college and did it but
i ultimately decided to go ahead and
finish college and go full time once i
graduated so i don't necessarily have
that story of like choosing to go full
on a certain date or something like that
but i do want to give you guys some
thoughts and if i
was in a position where i was still
working a full-time job and i needed to
when i wanted to actually go full-time
in my business these are the things i
would have been thinking about these are
the things that i
encourage you to think about when you're
thinking about whether or not you should
go full time so
the first thing is finances i feel like
this is kind of where you have to start
right because it's one of the biggest
things and the last thing i want you to
do is
to go full time in your small business
and to be stuck and not be able to
afford it so even though finances might
not be as fun to think about
i really want to encourage you to think
about it as one of the first stepping
blocks or stepping stones into why did i
say blocks
oh my gosh i'm stepping stones into
becoming a full-time business owner
honestly when you have financial freedom
you have so much freedom in your
business just as a whole
so i really want you to think about
finances i know that can be really
scary to think about but um the biggest
thing that i would tell you to have is
number one have at least
three to six months of an emergency fund
saved up
both in your business and in your
personal life so if your business is not
bringing in any income
that you're able to support yourself and
support your business for three to six
months i would err on the side of
six months if you don't have maybe
you're not married and don't have anyone
else supporting you
um and you could probably err on the
side closer to three months if you
do rely on someone else for the majority
of your income and you're not really the
breadwinner if that makes sense
so that's what i would encourage you
have an emergency fund
and if you're sitting here thinking well
then how much should that fund be that's
going to be different for every single
person right
your expenses are going to be different
how much you spend in your business how
much you spend in your personal life
how extravagant your life is or not
extravagant it is
um it's gonna be totally different for
everybody so that means you're probably
gonna have to do a little bit of work
and sit down and figure out how much you
spend in your business what your
expenses are every year
um typically on a monthly basis how much
your expenses are personally how much
you're spending in your personal life
and how much you need to bring to the
table in that
that's what you're going to have to look
at and figure out what you need to do
in order to be able to go full time so
that's the first step figuring out as a
whole your finances and what you need to
have in order
for you to go full time because the last
thing you want to do is go full time in
your business and be super excited about
and throw up this cute photo on
instagram and get a bunch of praise for
and then two months later you're stuck
you have no money left to pay your bills
you have no money left for your business
and now you have to go try to scrap and
find a part-time job or another
full-time job because
you don't have any money left so that's
the main thing that i would
really consider um the first biggest
thing that i would have in place before
i went full time
the second i think about is do you have
a consistent
do you have consistent bookings in your
business or do you have consistent
income in your business
um whether you're a service-based
business or an online product shop or
graphic designer or any other kind of
whatever business you are
do you have consistent income coming in
i think that goes without saying but do
you have consistent income coming in for
several months
that could match those expenses you have
and match the salary you need to make
because having those consistent bookings
is going to help you once you transition
into being full-time
to not only have that emergency fund
saved up but ideally you don't really
want to dip into that emergency fund
unless it's an emergency right so you
want to be able to have a track record
of bringing in enough income to cover
your expenses to cover your salary
and one book that i really recommend
that you read is called profit first and
i am still working through this book i'm
about halfway through right now
but it's really just such a great book
for prioritizing your salary over
business expenses so
if you feel like you're overspending in
your business and you're able to keep up
with your business expenses but then you
have nothing left to pay yourself
let's flip that around and i want you to
read profit first because it is one of
the most game-changing books i have read
and oh my gosh it's just i feel like
everybody needs to read it because it
can literally change your life
in in the area of your finances and just
affect you in so many ways so
i really encourage you to do that read
that book if you feel like you need to
switch some things around
it's really going to help you to see
where you need to change some things
and then another thing you need to think
about is where is your tipping point
so when i say tipping point what i mean
by this is that you have
automated as much as you can in your
business and you've also
outsourced as much as you possibly can
while maintaining those expenses
and making your profit a priority um
that you've done those things and you
feel like you're burning out i can think
for example one of my good friends when
she was deciding to go full time
she had outsworth so much in her
business and had so much
so many people helping her but she was
still feeling like she was working so
hard her business was growing so fast
and she just could not keep up with
having a full-time job and her business
so i feel like that's something really
to think about and if you're at the
point where
you know financially you can't go full
time in your business set or it just
would not be a good idea because
you rely on your income so much um i
would really think about what are some
things you can do to automate your
business more
what are some things you can do to
outsource more because you'll actually
make more money by outsourcing because
you can book more or do more
or sell more because you do that um i
would think about those things and
that's really going to help you to
figure out what are the things that
you need to change in order to keep
growing your business or keep sustaining
your business
while you're in your full-time job the
more that you can automate
and outsource um the better your more
your business is going to grow
and that's something that profit first
also touches on a lot it's the thought
the idea of
automating as much as you can before you
outsource and i think that's so
important i think that's something that
a lot of business owners
miss is it's still really important to
make sure you're automating things as
much as possible so having workflows for
um being organized with things and
having systems in place and streamlining
things so that
when you do pass it off to someone your
expense for that is not going to be as
high because they're not going to spend
all this time figuring it out you're
already going to have a system in place
so if you haven't already make sure
you're automating and streamlining as
much as possible
and then once you do that then
outsourcing as much as you can
without doing the things there that's
those people doing the things that you
don't have to do in your business
and i think when we talk about the
tipping point it's what's that point
where you've done all those things
and you're running your business and
you're working for your full-time job
and you feel like you just can't keep up
with it all and that you're burning
out and you're burning yourself out of
everything or maybe you have no
social time or no free time or a
personal life
um so figuring out where that tipping
point is to where
you're working so hard and you have
things so automated and you're working
not in the sense because you don't have
things automated but because you already
have a lot of things automated you have
people on your team helping you
and you're just your business is growing
so fast you can't keep up with it so
if the financial side is in place and
you have the finances to do it you're
feeling called to do it
um and you're at that tipping point
where you can't keep up with both
anymore then that's where i would say
that i would
um probably make that jump to go full
time if not then
um then pretty soon in the future that's
what i would think about if i was in
that position
and remember at the end of the day being
full-time in your business
does not equal success there are so many
successful business owners that still do
something else full-time
that still have a full-time job and keep
their business as a side hustle
especially like artists and makers and
creators and photographers and
people who just like to create and have
it as more of their side hustle it's
totally okay to keep it that way
if you love your full-time job don't
feel the pressure to go full time in
your business
don't feel like you have to do that in
order to succeed there's so many people
who are so successful that don't do that
so i don't want you to feel this
pressure like you have to go full time
in order to be successful
but if you are feeling called to make
that jump and you feel like you're at
that tipping point where you can't keep
doing both
um for very much longer and you have the
finances in place to do it where if
you're gonna have freedom still in your
then i would say to go for it and it's
one of the best journeys you can do
being an entrepreneur is so awesome and
i absolutely love it it's such a
such an awesome thing just to be your
own boss and to do your own thing and
i'm just excited for you and if you're
kind of at that point where you're
trying to figure out whether or not you
should go full time or what you should
do with that
