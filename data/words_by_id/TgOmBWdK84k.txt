hey friends welcome back to the book
club series where we distill and discuss
highlights from some of my favorite
books and today we're talking about
your money or your life by vikki robbins
which is one of the most important books
that completely changed my relationship
with money its subtitle is nine steps to
transforming your relationship with
money and achieving financial
independence which sounds a bit like
self-helpy but actually it's it's a very
well put together book that when i read
it really changed my mindset when it
came to
work and money and how it kind of fits
into my life let's start with a passage
from the book that really resonated with
once upon a time earning a living was
the means to an end
the means was earning and the end was
living but over time our relationship
with money
earning it spending it investing it
owning it protecting it worrying about
has taken over the major part of our
lives most of us spend more than 40
hours of the week's total of 168 hours
money we must take time to dress for our
jobs commute to our jobs
think about our jobs at work and when
we're at home decompress
from our jobs we must spend money to
maintain our jobs job costuming
commuting costs food bought expensively
at the workplace
with all that time and money spent on
and around our jobs
is it any wonder that we've come to take
our identities from them
when asked what do you do we don't say i
do plumbing we say
i am a plumber she goes on to make the
point that we're not really making a
from work do we come home from our
making a living activity with more life
do we bound through the door refreshed
and energized ready for a great evening
with family and friends
where's all the life that we supposedly
made at work and she says that for many
of us we're not making a living
instead we are making and dying we are
essentially wilding away
our life energy on this thing that we
call our job
in the hope that it's going to bring us
meaning and fulfillment
and joy and happiness and money and we
say that the things that we value our
friends our family our local community
and certainly
in in every study that's been done on
happiness those are the things that lead
to a happy meaningful and fulfilled life
and yet most of the hours that we spend
of our life energy is devoted to our
this is making a dying rather than
making a living so that was point number
one uh the next major theme in the book
is about the question what is enough in
an environment of more is better
enough is like the horizon always
receding and there's a concept that she
talks about that really illustrates this
and it's called the fulfillment curve
it shows the relationship between the
experience of fulfillment and the amount
of money that we spend
at the beginning of our lives more
possessions means more fulfillment as we
get our basic needs met
and as we move from the bare necessities
to the niceties the positive
relationship between new things and
fulfillment becomes more deeply embedded
we then move beyond niceties to luxuries
and throughout these stages we
increasingly come to associate
more money with increased levels of
fulfillment because that's the way the
curve is going but then one day we hit a
fulfillment ceiling where more money and
more possessions don't actually give us
lasting fulfillment and beyond that peak
of enough we then start to just
accumulate more and more clutter the
more and more stuff we buy and then the
fulfillment curve starts to go downwards
the more we spend the more we accumulate
but the less satisfaction we're able to
from these possessions and so with this
in mind what i think about all the time
is like where is my concept of enough
like in all the different aspects of
and in fact there's research from nobel
prize winning economist daniel kahneman
about this relationship between money
and happiness and he finds that at a
certain point
more money does not lead to more
happiness and that point of enough
in some of the studies is around 75 000
a year and so ultimately as robin says
fulfillment is our compass and our
rudder for transforming our relationship
with money
thirdly she talks a lot about how
instead of thinking of money as this
nebulous concept
we can think of money as our life energy
like the concept of money is quite hard
to define but what's always going to be
is that money is what we exchange our
life energy for our life energy is
essentially our allotment of time here
on earth the precious hours of life
available to us
so every expense that we have everything
that we buy is actually equivalent to
hours of life energy that we've given up
to earn the money to buy the thing and
once we start thinking of money as this
proxy for life energy we can start to
calculate the real cost of stuff
in terms of life energy for example if
we're eyeing up that new ipad air that
800 and we're working in a job that pays
us 10
an hour that would be 80 hours of life
energy we're exchanging for this ipad or
two weeks of full-time work and then we
can ask ourselves
is that really worth it on that note one
thing that really is worth the life
energy that we exchange for it
is investing in ourselves investing in
learning investing in our skills and a
fantastic way of doing that is by taking
online courses over a brilliant who are
very kindly sponsoring this video if you
haven't heard brilliant is an amazing
platform for interactive courses on
maths science and computer science the
courses are all engaging and interactive
and fun in a way that really
sort of teaches you the the bare bones
of the concept and then lets you apply
it to real life scenarios so it's much
more interesting than the way that we
learn school stuff one of their newer
courses that i've quite liked is about
knowledge and uncertainty and that looks
at things like bayesian networks causal
inference and information theory
but all in a package that's engaging and
accessible if you want to join me in
taking the class and investing in
yourself then head over to brilliant.org
forward slash ali and the first 200
people to hit that link will get 20
of the annual premium subscription
obviously any amount of money that we
is an exchange of our life energy but as
i said when we're investing in ourselves
that life energy is generally worth it
and it certainly is the case for
brilliant and in fact one way to justify
purchases of anything including
brilliant is by asking ourselves three
questions when it comes to the stuff
that we're buying firstly did i receive
fulfillment and satisfaction and value
in proportion to the life energy spent
and this question is good because it
forces us to think about
how much life energy we're actually
spending to acquire the things that we
think that we want
secondly is this expenditure of life
energy in alignment with my values and
life purpose
and this encourages us to think about
like is the thing that we're buying
actually in line with what we say we
want from life
and what we morally believe and thirdly
how might this expenditure change if i
didn't have to work
for money and this question is
interesting because it forces us to
think about like
whether we're buying this thing because
it relates to our job
for example if we're buying a fancy suit
to where to work to impress our
colleagues or a fancy watch that you
our colleagues can give a nod to if we
didn't have to go to work would we still
have that expense and i think it really
an aspect of life that we don't often
think about which is that
in order to maintain our jobs and
maintain our standard of living
supposedly for our peers we end up
spending a lot more money than we really
have to and so those were just three
discussion points from the book there is
so much more to talk about there's some
really interesting stuff in here about
jobs and the history of work and how we
think about money and leisure and
fulfillment and meaning and all that
kind of stuff but if you want to learn
about how
i've personally applied the principles
in here to achieve financial
independence then hit the playlist over
which talks about how i developed
various streams of passive income to get
to this point of financial independence
thank you very much for watching i hope
you enjoyed this video and i'll see you
in the next one
