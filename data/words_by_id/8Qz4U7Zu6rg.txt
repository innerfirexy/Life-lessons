all right on to the story of how i
auditioned for this commercial with shaq
i originally got my first audition for
back in october of 2020 so right in the
middle of the pandemic here in the
united states
and that's going to be important later
on in this story
but anyway when i first got the audition
there was no mention that shaq
was going to be a part of this
commercial nothing in the audition
said anything about shaq all i knew was
the audition was for
an epson product and epson is a company
that makes printers and scanners and all
kinds of different office products
and that's all i knew and the original
audition was
a self tape and it was almost all improv
they gave i think four or five
questions that they want us to improvise
and answer
nothing scripted so i recorded my
and i sent it to my agent and they sent
it on to the casting directors
about two or three days later um
let me see oh no it was a week later a
week later i found out that i got a
for this audition so the callback was
going to be
live on zoom so not in person again
we're in the middle of the pandemic so
they had
zoom callbacks and it was with the
director of the commercial
and the callback was once again
all improv some of the questions were
the same as the ones that i had recorded
and some of the questions were different
but nothing was scripted
just asking questions and then me
answering them on the
on the zoom callback once again there
was no mention of shaq
i had no idea that shaquille o'neal was
part of this
at all so after the zoom callback
later that day so i think the callback
was sometime in the early afternoon
maybe 1pm or 2pm
and then later that day i got an email
from my agent and said
hey you are on first refusal if you
don't know
what first refusal is first refusal
basically means that you
are on their short list you are in high
consideration for this commercial
so they said block out those days so
they gave me two or three different days
that they were
planning on shooting us shooting this
commercial so they said
block out those days don't take any
other jobs for those days because you
are on high consideration for this job
so then i didn't hear anything for two
days after that
and then on the third day i found out
i was released from first refusal my
agent sent me an email says
unfortunately they've
gone in a different direction and you
are released and this happens all the
time this is
a part of the industry the way that this
works is that
a lot of companies will put multiple
actors on first refusal
because they are they're maybe their top
two or top three choices and they hadn't
made a final decision yet
so they put multiple actors on first
refusal and then finally
they make their final decision they cast
one of them the other ones have to be
and this happened to me before so nah i
i was not happy about it but i knew that
it comes with the territory that's part
of the business
so after i got released i just assumed
okay well that's the end of that job
i'm gonna move on to whatever's next but
three days later
i found out that i got another audition
for epson they were shooting
a separate commercial for another epson
the same director the same company was
shooting another commercial
and they wanted me to audition again the
this one was not going to be self-taped
this one was going to be
another live in or not in person but
on zoom unfortunately i was not
during the time that they wanted me to
audition so
we tried to figure out our schedules and
find a different time
where i could audition unfortunately
nothing would match up and i couldn't do
it and i thought ah i lost my
opportunity again
but they were nice enough to say the
director said
even though kurt can't make the actual
audition time
we're going to consider him still for
this spot by just reviewing his initial
audition and his call back
from the other commercial because they
already got to know me they already got
to see what my acting ability was and
everything like that
so they decided okay we can't consider
him based on another live
audition but we can still consider him
based on what we've seen
already which was great and once again i
didn't hear
anything for two days and on the third
day this time
i wasn't released i got good news i
found out that i was
booked for the commercial now once i was
still no mention of shaq nobody told me
that shaq was involved in this
commercial at all
now before we get into what happened
during the commercial let me give you a
recap on the timeline here because i got
my first audition for the commercial on
october 9th and then i self-taped my
my audition and i sent it in and then i
got a call back
then i got put on first refusal then i
was released then i got my second
i couldn't make the second audition they
reviewed my previous audition and my
callback then i got put on first refusal
and i was eventually booked on october
30th so it was a total of 21 days
since my first audition to the day they
finally booked me
and then we we shot the commercial on
november 6th so a week after
my actual booking when did i find out
that shaq was
involved in the commercial well
somewhere between october 30th when i
booked it and the day that we shot on
november 6
one of those days i can't remember which
one they had me
do a call a zoom call with the wardrobe
to discuss what i will be wearing for
the commercial
during that conversation she
accidentally let it slip
that shaq was gonna be in the commercial
she thought that i already knew and i
had no idea
and she apologized because she said it
was supposed to be a surprise
and uh even though i'm totally cool with
i think i would have freaked out if i if
it was a real surprise when i showed up
on set
so i was really excited when i found out
that shaq was going to be involved i was
a huge fan of shaq when he was playing
in the nba
and then even after he retired i watched
him all the time on inside the nba on tv
so you know he's a huge huge celebrity
so that's how i found out that shaq was
going to be in the commercial so now
let's fast forward to
november 6 the day that we shot the
on the day when we shot my scenes
remember i told you that my auditions
were all improvised
and it was for a different product so
when we shot my scenes they did give me
a script but they told me this is a
loose script
we're not going to stick to it word for
word you can work on a little bit but
we'll also
improvise during the shoot as well and
that's exactly what we did
we did some of the script but then we
also the director gave me some lines
that were not written
then i improvised some responses and
that's how we shot the entire thing
here's the thing shaq was there that day
and they shot shaq's parts
but i never got to meet him he was on
but we never actually got to be in the
same room together and part of the
for that was because we were still in
the middle of the pandemic
remember i told you earlier that that
was going to be important later on
because it was in the middle of the
pandemic the production was following
strict covet protocols and they didn't
want people
in the same room where they didn't want
a lot of people gather them in the same
all the time so they filmed all of
shaq's parts in a totally separate room
and all of my parts in a totally
separate room
we never got to actually hang out or
talk or anything like that
i did however pass him in the hallway
one time while he was having a
conversation with somebody else i walked
past him
and he was an enormous human being oh i
did see him
a second time at the very end of the day
he was leaving and saying goodbye to
and he kind of popped his head in the
room and and said goodbye
um it seemed like a super nice guy
i just never had a got a chance to have
a conversation with him
but i mean he gave me a call out by my
in the commercial so how cool is that i
couldn't ask for anything better
okay so i think there are two big
takeaways that i think
everyone should take away from this
whole story
the first takeaway is that and i
mentioned this multiple times during my
story already is that
i didn't know shaq was going to be
involved in this commercial
and this actually happens quite a lot in
this industry whenever there's a big
celebrity that might be involved in a
commercial or in a project or someone's
making a cameo in something they like to
keep that
as secret as possible because they don't
want it leaked right they don't want it
leaked on social media or something like
so they only tell people on a need to
know basis if you don't need to know
they wait until the last minute before
they reveal it
and this again happens for a lot of
commercials and it even happens
in movies and tv shows too when i worked
on an
episode of the show the first back in i
think 2017
this was a show on hulu it only got one
season so people probably aren't too
familiar with it
but it was a show about uh the mission
to mars
and when i worked on that show sean penn
was one of the main characters maybe he
was the main character i'm not 100 sure
but he was
one of the main characters on that show
but he was never listed on the call
sheet nobody knew that sean penn was
going to be on that show until they
showed up
and i had no idea until i showed up on
set and hey there was sean penn
oscar winner sean penn so that happens
on tv shows too and sometimes in movies
also for projects sometimes when you're
auditioning for a project
and if it's a high profile project they
won't tell you what it is
marvel projects are notorious for this
if you get an audition for the next
new marvel movie they won't tell you
which movie it is it'll just say
marvel and that's it and you you'll have
to guess on which one it is or if it's
for a new marvel show
i remember when my friends here in
atlanta were auditioning for
captain america winter soldier um or the
falcon in the winter soldier
uh they were not they were not told
what show they were auditioning for they
all all they knew was
it was a new disney plus show and i
think they might have said marvel in it
didn't say what show it was so that
happens a lot in this industry anything
there is something big
they tend to keep it a secret and tend
to keep play it close to the best
because they don't want things
shared and spoiled on social media
okay the second big takeaway i want to
share with you
about this story was that remember that
booked this second commercial without
ever auditioning for it
they hired me based on what they saw
from my first commercial
my first audition and my callback and
this happens quite a bit in this
industry too
i've talked about this in other videos
how it's happened to me
for many other projects uh when i
when i booked my role on cobra kai i
never auditioned for that role i
auditioned for other roles on cobra kai
that i didn't end up booking but
eventually they offered me a role
that i never auditioned for when i
booked my role
on the movie venom i didn't audition for
that role i auditioned for a different
that they use that audition to
eventually decide to cast me
in that role and i think that's really
important for people to understand of
how the casting process works
when you audition for something you're
never auditioning for just that one role
they use that audition to consider you
for many other things
potentially other roles in that project
potentially for
other projects and potentially just for
that casting director to keep you in
their mind for future things or for the
director to keep you in mind for future
things so
every audition is yes it is an audition
that particular role but it's also an
for future projects future roles
anything that could
potentially help you in the future oh
and one more thing that i wanted to
this was actually the second time that i
was in a commercial with shaq
the first time i was an extra in a
years ago i think it was for the nba
and that time i also did not get to meet
so first two times on set with shaq
both times i never got to meet him maybe
third time's the charm so hopefully at
some point
in my career i will get to be in another
project with shaq
and hopefully that time i will get to
meet him alright that's it for this
video guys if you liked it please give
it a thumbs up if you have any questions
leave them down in the comments below
and until next time
keep practicing keep learning and i hope
to see you on set one day
