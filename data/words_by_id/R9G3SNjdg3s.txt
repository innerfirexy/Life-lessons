like how to join when to join whether or
not you should join

take into consideration so

all right let's get started today we're
going to be talking about
sag-aftra joining the union sag-aftra is
a labor union here in the united states
that represents film and television
actors commercial actors as well as some
tv and radio hosts and some other
professions as well but we're not really
concerned about those things
for the purposes of this video we're
really just concerned about the film and
television and commercial acting
side of the union a few quick
disclaimers before we get started
one i want to make sure you understand
that we're only talking about sag after
here in the united states i know there
are other unions that represent
performers in
other countries but i have no experience
with those so i can't really speak about
those at all
secondly i want you to know that we are
only talking about sag-aftra this
particular union
there are other unions here in the
united states that represent actors for
instance there's a separate union that
reps actors for stage work
for plays but again we're not talking
about that
the purpose of this video is strictly
talking about sag-aftra
and how to join and when to join that
particular union the last disclaimer is
i want you to understand that this is
only based on my personal opinion
and my experience both as a non-union
earlier on in my career and then later
on as a union actor
after i joined the union this is
important because i do know that there
are other people in the industry that
have had different experiences than i
and may give slightly different advice
that i would give and i do think that's
important to hear those different
because joining the union is a very
important decision
and it's a big decision it shouldn't be
made lightly or quickly
so it is important to find advice from
many different
sources and i'll speak about that later
on in the video as well
about where else you should be seeking
advice on this topic
all right we got a lot to cover in this
video and i think this is going to be
the most
logical order to cover things so first
we're going to talk about what is
sag-aftro what its purpose is
what it means to be a sag after a member
what the rules are and what the
differences are between being non-union
and being union
then we'll talk about how to join
sag-aftra so what steps you need to take
to become eligible and then to join
and then finally we'll talk about the
very complex topic
of whether or not you should join when
to join
and then what things you should be
taking into consideration before you do
so what is sag-aftra sag-aftra is a
labor union here in the united states
with about 160 000 members
and it represents actors in film
television commercials
voice over and various other categories
what is the purpose of sag-aftra well
this is directly from their website
the main goal of sag-aftra is to provide
competitive wages and safe excellent
working conditions for
our members so in other words sag-aftra
is here to make sure that actors are
earning a fair wage for the work that
they do
and to make sure that the sets that they
work on are safe and that they get
proper benefits just like
any other job so what's the difference
between being union and non-union well
the term union status is something that
you will hear
all the time in this industry and union
status can refer
to two things it can refer to either a
or a production so a performer an actor
can be union or
non-union and a production can also be
either union
or non-union so what's the difference
let's talk about actors first
the biggest difference between a
non-union actor and a union actor is
types of projects that you are allowed
to work on
so if you are a non-union actor you are
allowed to
audition for and work on both non-union
and union projects now to an extent
there might be a cut off for union
but for the most part you are allowed to
audition for
and work on both sides now if you are
a union actor that is not the case once
you decide to join the union
you are no longer allowed to work on
non-union projects
anymore so that is the biggest
difference once you are a
union member you can only work on union
projects from that day
forward whereas a non-union actor can
also work on non-union projects
as much as they want to so now let's
talk about the difference between
non-union and union productions the
biggest difference here is that union
have to follow all of the union
guidelines so they have to pay the
union wages they have to follow all of
the set
safety protocols that's dictated by the
union to make sure the sets are safe
they have to provide proper benefits to
all of the performers
and because of that it typically costs
more money for a production to go
union to follow all of those guidelines
now non-union productions
don't have to follow any of those rules
nine union productions can do whatever
they want they can pay whatever wages
they want however small or large
they can set whatever rules that they
want to on set they don't have to follow
certain safety precautions or provide
any benefits or any of those things
so now you might wonder what uh what's
the reason a production would want to go
union if it does cost more to go union
well the reason
would come down to the performers that
they will want to hire
because 99 of the top actors
in hollywood are all union members
and remember we said earlier union
actors can only work on union
projects so if i'm producing a movie and
i want to hire
a big time actor i have to make my
production a union production or
in order for them to be allowed to work
on my project
that's why all major movies and
television shows here in the united
states are sag-aftra productions
so now why do non-union productions even
exist well there are certain projects
where they don't necessarily need to
hire a big celebrity
for instance i've done a ton of acting
work for
companies where i've done training
videos now a training video for a
company is not going to hire
an a-list celebrity they can hire you
know any local actor that they have
in that market and a lot of times those
local actors are not union
so they don't necessarily have to make
their productions union now i also
want to make sure that it's clear i'm
not saying all non-union productions are
either i've worked on plenty of
non-union productions that have been
that have paid great wages that have
treated the actors well
that have provided safe working
conditions so not all non-union
productions are terrible
the point is that non-union productions
don't have to follow
all of those rules whereas union
productions do so for non-union
productions you're kind of just trusting
those producers to do everything the
right way
and whereas for union productions you
have a little bit more confidence in
because they've signed a contract to say
they definitely will do things the right
okay now that we've talked about what
the union is and
what it means to be both union and
non-union now let's talk about how to
i'm going to put a link down in the
description to the specific page on the
sag after a website
about how to join because the ways to
join may change in the future
and i don't want to be giving out false
information i'm going to tell you what
the ways to join are
now but make sure you check that link if
you're watching this well into the
because you want to make sure that
you're seeing current information so
there are the ways to join the union out
is that first you have to gain
eligibility you can't just
call up the union make a phone call and
say hey i want to join they tell you to
you have to become eligible first and
there are currently three ways to become
eligible again
check the website for specific
descriptions about these three ways
the current three ways to join the union
are one you can book a principal role on
a union production
not a background role a principal role
usually means a speaking role if you
book a principal role on a union
you become eligible immediately another
way to become eligible is to get
three union background vouchers so if
you work background
on three union product projects and you
get three
union background vouchers again check
the website about exactly what that
then you also become eligible and then
third if you are
already a member of one of their sister
unions if you are a member of say
actors equity for example then you are
eligible to join sag-aftra once you
eligible to join sag-aftra if you've
done one of those three things
then that eligibility does not expire
you can
elect to join at any point in your
how do you join well you have to pay an
initiation fee and that initiation fee
isn't cheap
currently the fee to join sag-aftra
nationwide is
three thousand dollars now if you decide
to join in
a different market depending on where
you live it may cost a little bit less
for instance when i joined sag-aftra
here in atlanta it only cost
me fifteen hundred dollars but that's
only if i work on union projects here in
and the south east if i work on a union
in california for instance or new york
for instance then i would have to pay
the difference and i will have to pay
the full three thousand dollars
so whenever you decide to join the union
understand that you will have to pay
the three thousand dollar initiation fee
that is a one-time fee it's not annual
it's a one-time three thousand dollar
initiation fee
to join sag-aftra then you get your
union card
and you are a sag-aftra member now
in order to remain in the union you do
have to pay annual dues annual base dues
around 200 something dollars again check
the website for the exact number and
then you also have to pay 1.5 percent
on your earnings for the year so those
are your annual dues so
that's how you join the union and stay
in the union finally
the question that you came here for when
should you join the union
and what factors should you take into
consideration well like i mentioned
earlier on in the beginning of the video
this is a very
important decision it's a big decision
and it shouldn't be taken lightly
because i do think there is such a thing
as joining too
early remember that once you become a
union member you can never work on
non-union productions ever again so you
better be sure
that you're willing to give up all of
those opportunities for the rest of your
like i said i've worked on some great
non-union productions that have made me
that have been credits on my resume that
been footage on my demo reel and a great
experience on
set and networking opportunities and all
of that so
make sure that you're ready to give up
all of those types of experiences on
non-union productions
when you decide to join the union that's
why i want you to get advice from as
resources as possible not just me i mean
i'm going to try to give you the best
information as i can
but there are going to be other people
that have different experiences than me
and may have other perspectives
especially especially people
that are in your market seek advice from
actors from acting teachers from
agents and casting directors that live
where you
are in your city or your state because
locations may have different
considerations when you're deciding to
join the union let me just give you an
example from my personal experience
when i lived in ohio i never wanted to
join the union because
99 of the work that was available for
actors in ohio
was non-union so when i lived there if i
ever joined the union while living in
i would be cut off from almost all the
potential work that was available to me
because there were no tv shows and
any movies that ever filmed in that
so i would have gone from getting you
a handful of auditions a month to maybe
a handful of auditions a year
that would have been a really poor
decision for me had i decided to join
the union in ohio
now if i lived in california or new york
for instance
it would have been a totally different
story because there are union
available in those markets so that's why
it is very important to take into
consideration your location
and because i haven't lived in every
city and every state i don't know what
it's like
in all in every market in the country so
that's why i encourage you to get advice
from people
in your market another thing that you
may need to think about is whether or
not you can get
union auditions when you are a non-union
i mentioned earlier that yes you are
allowed to audition for union projects
when you are non-union but whether or
not you actually get those auditions is
a different story
sometimes in certain markets and certain
productions they may
prioritize giving auditions to union
actors first
before looking at non-union actors so in
those instances if you want to get an
audition for those coveted roles and
movies and television shows
you may be allowed to get those
auditions when you are non-union
but maybe they're only looking at union
actors first and they find who they're
looking for
before they even get to you so sometimes
in those markets
you may have to join the union before
you can get those auditions now that is
not the case here in atlanta
and the southeast so in this market
union actors and non-union actors
they're kind of considered on a level
playing field they don't
prioritize one over the other but i have
heard of that
happening in uh markets like la where
do prioritize union actors over nine
union actors for certain auditions
so that's something to consider as well
and again that's a reason
to check with people in your market to
see if that is happening
and then finally this is one final thing
to consider in terms of location
i know this is a lot but this is really
important as well and that is right to
work laws you really need to look at
whether or not the state that you live
in or the state
that you plan to live in to pursue
is a right to work state or a union
state currently
in 2020 roughly half the states in the
united states i think a little over half
the states
in the country are right to work states
and the other half are union states
what's the difference between the two
well in right to work states
union laws the union laws that apply to
forcing people to join
don't apply in right to work states in
union states they do apply
what does this mean for actors and
sag-aftra well
it has to do with whether or not you can
be forced to join the union so
in a union state you must join the union
you must join sag-aftra
after working your second union job
after 30 days of working your second
union job
you must join the union before you can
work on any
future union jobs now in a right to work
those rules don't apply so for instance
the state that i live in
georgia is a right to work state so in
this state
i can work on as many union projects as
i want
before i have to join the union in fact
i never have to join the union
and i have the ability to work on
non-union projects and union projects
for for the rest of my life
if i want to this happens in
right-to-work states in union states
you do have to join the union after a
certain number of jobs
so what this means for actors is that if
you live in a right to work state
then the power is kind of in your hands
on when you want to join the union
because you are never forced to
you don't have to join after working
only two union jobs you can work on 3 4
15 20 before you elect to join that's
what happened to me
i actually worked on quite a few union
jobs here in atlanta before i
elected to join the union back in 2019.
so that's something you should take into
consideration depending on where you
live and whether or not your location
is a right-to-work state it's also
something you should think about when
you're deciding where you want to move
to pursue your acting career if you move
to a new york or an la
both of those are union states where
union rules apply and you can be forced
to join the union
whereas if you move to a market like
atlanta here in the southeast
right to work st right to work rules
apply and
you are never forced to join the union
and you can elect
to join the union when you decide it's
the right time for you
and then finally i think the last thing
that everybody needs to take into
is cost we talked about earlier that it
cost three thousand dollars
to join the union nationally so you
definitely gotta make sure that you have
the money saved up to join the union
when you decide to do so all right we
definitely covered a lot in this video i
know you're gonna have some questions so
feel free to leave them down in the
comments below
if you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and until next time keep
practicing keep
learning and i hope to see you on set
one day
