hey guys so in this video we are going
over six very bad money habits that are
keeping people poor
this applies to people making minimum
wage but it also applies to people
making millions of dollars a year
it also applies to anyone who wants to
prioritize their financial situation
millions or billions of people
at the end of the month they look at
their bank accounts and they wonder
where all their money has gone think
about how much nicer it'd be for you to
see a positive balance and be able to
save or invest that money so with that
being said
let's get started so the first one on
the list is keeping too much stuff and
this is basically just
anti-minimalism interestingly enough
people have begun downsizing their homes
with the average square footage
declining each year since 2015. now this
is great and all but people are actually
slower to give up their stuff
instead they're moving all their stuff
to a storage unit and guys this costs a
lot of money
it's a recurring monthly charge and even
if you don't have a storage unit it's
costing you in mental space
keeping track of all the stuff deters
you from channeling your energy
towards actually just making more money
so i want you guys to consider what type
of mindset you have
when keeping the things that you rarely
use most people are going to place a
dollar amount
on the item so for example let's say we
have a bookshelf that
we used to use but now just doesn't
really fit with our new space
a lot of people are going to want to
keep that item because they assign a 100
value or worth to that bookshelf and as
a result that type of mindset makes it
really hard to throw things away
because obviously you're not going to go
out and throw a 100 bill away right and
if you think that bookshelf is worth a
hundred dollars then you're just not
gonna do that instead what i want you
guys to try and do is attach a monthly
of keeping it so for example this
bookshelf let's say it costs
three dollars a month of storage as well
as one dollar a month of mental
capacity that's four dollars a month or
48 dollars per year
if you think about like that it becomes
a lot more obvious what you should do
with the item so if you have items like
that in your life
consider donating them consider selling
them especially if you don't think
you're gonna use it again in the next
couple of years just really don't think
of it as having any value and rather
take on the perspective of how much it's
costing you to keep that item
if you guys are donating it make sure to
get a tax deduction as i could
definitely decrease your taxable income
and really for all the stuff just move
on it's really holding you down once you
get rid of this habit it's going to be a
lot easier to save money and not keep
items that are just costing us way too
much money to do so okay second on my
list is
investing procrastination the
unfortunate truth is that too many
people they just wait too long until
they start investing and letting their
work for them if you look at the numbers
the difference in delaying your
investing by one single year is going to
have a massive
impact on your overall portfolio so if
your goal is to build up wealth if it's
to build up a massive
portfolio of stocks then investing as
early as you can is just super super
important the main reason for this is
it's due to compound interest
the more years you spend in the market
invested in stocks
the more your money is going to grow
especially when you get to the
exponential phase of investing now
unfortunately this doesn't happen in the
10 to 20 years this happens between the
years 20 and 40. that's where you really
see the exponential growth that comes
with long-term investing and even for
people with not too much money to invest
i say just get started you guys get that
snowball rolling
that way you have your account set up so
when you have more money later on
it's just a lot easier to take that
money and automatically invest it when
it comes to investing you want to remove
all the barriers to investing anyways if
you guys have not yet signed up for
make sure to do so right now and get
your free four stocks all you have to do
is open up an account
deposit 100 or more and those four free
stocks will be automatically deposited
into your account
i'll put a link to it in the description
below this really all just ties into
financial education
people are scared to invest and get it
it is pretty scary not having money in
the bank
makes it feel like your money is not
with you it's out there doing something
on its own and that's definitely
extremely uncomfortable for a lot of
people however when you learn about how
investing works
and the whole history of investing
you'll see how much other people have
made by investing their money and just
not letting it sit in their savings
account and when you learn all this
it makes you not scared of investing now
i do think most of you guys
probably have started investing so just
really prioritize saving
and investing that money and if you
haven't yet start investing i really
encourage you
start doing that today get those free
stocks with weeble and you'll get an
instant return on your investment and i
guarantee you your future self is going
to be so happy that you started today
next up is focusing only on the present
and not on the future
not having this whole savings mindset i
think too many people they live
in the moment and they don't think of
things in terms of opportunity cost so
basically what that means is when you're
spending money you are
forgoing investing that money right now
this can totally change your perspective
on money so for example let's say you
a 25 meal if you spend that money right
now on that meal
it's basically gonna be worth 50 in 10
years if you had
invested it and that's a very
conservative number if you invest that
money right it's probably going to be
worth a lot more than 50
the same thing applies to let's say a 10
shot of tequila at the bar
is taking that shot of tequila right now
worth having let's say
20 or 30 dollars in 10 years because if
not then
don't make that purchase i encourage you
guys to think of every single purchase
in your life
like this and when you do that it makes
it a lot harder to purchase things that
aren't necessary now of course you do
have to have some type of balance to
if you only think about the future and
don't treat yourself now
then that really is a terrible way to
live what you want to do is you want to
spend money on the right things
and save on the right things as well we
should always be looking out for the
especially if you want to become wealthy
there's just way too many temptations in
life that threaten to steal our money
from us
so really i encourage you guys to
embrace the savings mindset
think of things in terms of opportunity
cost and your savings will increase
dramatically the next bad money habit
that i want you guys
to consider is not spending enough money
or time on your self education now i'm
not just talking about college because
to be honest
that's probably not the best use of
money for a lot of people that don't
want to go into a traditional career i'm
talking more about spending money and
more importantly your time
on self-improvement every single day
think of your brain as a tool that can
make you money people hire you for your
brain you're only going to make as much
money as your tools allow you to
really it is impossible to make millions
and millions of dollars and escape the
rat race
by just doing what everyone else is
doing and by that i mean just
not caring about financial literacy not
reading self-improvement books and not
getting out of your comfort zone believe
it or not
99 of people just don't do these things
i know you're one of the few that do
because you're actively searching for
and watching this type of stuff
on youtube and when you improve yourself
this means that you're improving the
that you see around us a lot of people
view making money
as extremely challenging but one big
reason for that is because
there are so many opportunities to make
money that we don't see unless we
challenge our brains
to see it self-improvement reading all
the stuff it's like having a pair of
glasses that allows you to see
making money in a different way i
guarantee you that if you focus on
financial literacy
on self improvement this is going to
lead to an immediate boost
in your income this literally happened
to me you guys i'm not joking the moment
i started reading the moment i started
waking up early and
doing all the stuff for myself my income
went up so much
the next bad money habit to break is
spending money like you're rich
and this has a lot to do with
convenience versus savings let me tell
you guys a little story about
my family so my parents they always had
a good income
my dad was a software engineer and my
mom was a statistician we were fortunate
enough to never really worry about money
but my parents they just didn't spend
money like they had a good amount of it
we rarely ate out and if we didn't eat
out it'd be at some really cheap place
and they were frugal on pretty much
everything this was a really great
lesson because growing up
rich but seeing my parents still be so
careful with their money
really taught me that we don't need to
spend like we're rich even if we do have
the money it's always helpful to adopt
this mindset
even if you're poor even if you're rich
it really does not matter we are faced
with this option
every single day paying for convenience
or saving money for example let's talk
about coffee this is where we have
starbucks versus making it at home
starbucks can seem like it's a lot more
convenient because you just go there
pay and get your drink versus if you're
making it at home you actually have to
go buy the coffee beans buy a coffee
maker and then just do it yourself same
thing with eating right you can easily
go out and get takeout for each meal
or you can go grocery shopping and make
meals in bulk to save money so i always
thought that these things were things
that only rich people did one
in reality a lot of broke people will
keep eating out frequently they'll spend
on convenience when they can't actually
afford it and they'll make large
all the time it's important to spend
like your poor until you make
income for now focus on saving and not
convenience until your time becomes
super valuable this is going to help you
prevent living paycheck to paycheck
and not being able to save enough money
to invest it properly
okay next is just having too many
impulsive purchases
these days companies are so good at
making people buy things
with their emotions and on impulse
especially with the rise of e-commerce
people can now buy anything with
literally just
one click of a mouse it's crazy but 40
of e-commerce purchases
are impulsive and when you look at
statistics like that it really makes you
how many things have i bought that were
impulsive now to combat this
one really great way to do so is to
implement the five day rule
what this is is you're basically going
to wait five days before you purchase
anything and what this does is it helps
you get rid of that emotional spending i
guarantee you that ninety percent of the
purchases that you make
won't look that great in five days this
literally just happened to me you guys i
was thinking about buying these nano
leaf light panels that looked
super cool they're like 150 to 200 for
nine little panels and i just thought it
would make a pretty cool addition to
this office space i was this close to
buying it five days later i went back to
my shopping cart and i was like
i don't think i actually need these and
it's because that whole initial appeal
of something new just sort of faded with
time this is just a little trick that
you guys can use to reduce your spending
so that you can increase your savings
anyways i hope you guys found these tips
useful these are habits that
everyone should try and overcome
especially if you want to prioritize
your financial situation and just create
more wealth these are very common habits
so don't feel bad if you do them but
definitely consider what i'm saying and
try and stop doing these things there's
a reason why most people just never
break out of that lower to middle class
lifestyle and get into that whole
upper and ultra high net worth bracket
it's because stopping these habits is
extremely hard
and it's extremely uncomfortable but
with that being said i encourage you
guys to
just take this information and try and
take action if any of these things
applies to you it'll have a really big
long-term effect
on your net worth and again make sure to
