so is it possible to live in a house or
apartment for free
in this video we are exploring some real
life strategies that you can use
to pay zero dollars for housing yes i
said it with
house hacking you can live in a house or
duplex or triplex and pay little to
and best of all you don't need to be
rich to start so why aren't more people
doing this
well it's pretty complicated and it's a
lot harder than it looks
but before we explore how you can start
house hacking it helps to have a clear
of what house hacking is house hacking
is when you rent out part of your
primary residence to tenants
and the rent that those tenants pays you
helps to offset or
fully cover the mortgage and cost of
ownership i did this for a few years
after buying my first property
and it greatly reduced my living
expenses here in los angeles so yeah i
owe a lot to house hacking here are the
pros of house hacking
first is you build equity right whenever
you're paying off your mortgage there
are two
parts of that one is your interest so
that's the cost of borrowing the money
and the second is paying down your
principal or the equity you have
in the home this is basically just like
a for savings account
it's cool because the portion of your
mortgage payment is just going back into
your equity in the home so it's
literally just
building your net worth the second is
you have the option to put a really
down payment on the home and since
you're living there you get access to
really great interest rates this means
that you don't have to have a ton of
money saved up in the bank it also means
that the cost of borrowing money is
extremely low
especially right now third pro of house
hacking is it allows you to get
involved in real estate investing as
soon as possible since you're able to
put such a small down payment
this is really one of the best ways for
anyone to get into real estate investing
and you'll find that once you get
comfortable with house hacking
you'll probably move on to bigger and
better deals and of course one of the
biggest things with house hacking is
that you are
saving a ton of money most americans are
spending like 30 to 40 percent
of their income on housing so just think
about if you got rid of these payments
how much money you'd end up saving now
the first step in house hacking is
intent you need to intend to live there
as your primary residence that and you
also have to be okay
becoming a landlord house hacking is not
for everyone and
you need to be prepared for the
downsides this includes reduced privacy
and you'll likely need to at least share
some common spaces like the driveway the
backyard or any other common areas the
level of privacy invasion depends on
what type of home
you are buying if you're buying a house
or a condo you'll probably have to share
the kitchen and the living room if
you're buying a duplex then you only
have to share
the driveway or maybe the backyard so
yes house hacking is less comfortable
being the only person living on your
property but the trade-off
is worth it for most people second is
you need to run the numbers we want to
figure out what your budget is and how
much house you can afford so to do this
we will want to speak with a mortgage
lender in your area tell them about your
and about how you want to house hack and
then give them your financial
information they're going to work with
you to come up with a plan on how to
carry out the house hacking process you
can also speak with a real estate agent
as well as they do have really good
insights into the local market
and what rents you should expect it also
helps to do your own research too
so here are my tips on finding good
properties to house hack
basically we are looking for properties
with as much potential as possible to
generate revenue for example let's say
that you want to buy a house and are
okay with roommates
ideally we want to find a house with
many bedrooms which means that you can
live in one of them and rent out the
rest the more bedrooms the better your
numbers are going to be
also i want you guys to think outside
the box is there an opportunity
to do a short-term rental on airbnb for
example you could build something like
an adu in the backyard and build a
separate entrance
or you could park an rv on your lot and
rent that out you can also convert
spaces into additional rooms so maybe
you take something like an
unlivable basement and then add a
bathroom and kitchen and all that stuff
there's a lot more to it than just
having more bedrooms and you need to be
aware of that now if you're looking for
a duplex triplex or fourplex
then you could live in one unit and rent
out the others so
obviously the more rentable units the
better the triplex has twice as many
rental units as a duplex because with a
duplex you can only rent out one unit
and with a triplex you have two rentable
units and even better is a fourplex
where you have three rentable units
now anything four units or smaller is
going to count as a residential property
which is where you want to be commercial
properties of anything with five or more
units is going to be considered a
commercial property
and commercial properties can be great
for more advanced
investors but the loan terms are way
worse and i just don't recommend it for
a first
time house hacker the best deals are
going to involve some type of blend
creativity and potential revenue and
each area and property is going to be
different what works in one city might
not work in another and this has a lot
to do with permit laws and rental rates
so now let's go through an example of a
sample deal which
may or may not be possible depending on
where you live let's say you buy a home
500 000 and you put a down payment of
five percent this means that you're
getting a loan for
475 000 and putting 25k
down with an interest rate of 3 and a
loan term of 30 years
this means that your monthly mortgage
payment is going to come out to around
twenty seven hundred dollars per month
now right off the bat you can see that
with a low down payment of five percent
you're only putting down
twenty five thousand dollars and the
monthly payment of twenty seven hundred
dollars is not too bad especially if you
consider the fact
that you could potentially rent out some
of these rooms or if it's a multi-unit
property then you can rent out those
other units
so best case scenario let's say that
this 500 000 property is a fourplex
we have four units total so i'm gonna
draw that right here you are going to be
in one of them so this is you and you're
going to have three units that you can
out now this is going to really depend
on where you live but let's say that
you can rent out each of these units for
1 000
per month so one thousand one thousand
and one thousand
this means that in total you are
bringing in three thousand dollars
per month in rental income and if you
compare that to the
2700 monthly payment you can see that
there is
a net surplus of about 300 so this is
going to be
your profit each and every month this
means that you literally get to live for
in your unit and have your three tenants
pay down your mortgage
build your equity in the home and yeah
it comes out to you making 300
to live in that property so you can see
just how amazing this type of house
hacking can be
especially if you can find the right
type of deal another really great way to
house hack is to buy a fixer-upper for
renovate it and then live in it for at
least two years as your primary
residence the reason why this is amazing
is because of capital gains tax
let's say you buy a property for three
hundred thousand dollars
you spend about fifty thousand dollars
to renovate it
meaning your all in cost is going to be
000 after living there for two years the
house is now worth
500 000 which means that there is a
of k so this is your profit now normally
when you buy an
asset and then sell it for more later on
you're going to be subject to capital
gains tax
this long term capital gains tax is
going to be 0
15 or 20 percent depending on your
income level so let's say you're in the
highest income bracket meaning you're
20 for long-term capital gains this
means that you're going to be subject
to 30 000 in taxes on the sale now the
amazing thing is if you actually live in
this property for
two or more years the irs is not going
to tax you on up to 250 000
in capital gains or if you're married
500 000
in capital gains so right off the bat
you can see just how amazing this
strategy is
because you can sort of combine the
house hacking with this tax
advantage and if you're young and you
want to live with college students house
hacking works extremely well if you live
in a college town you can rent out maybe
like a house with let's say five
live in one of those bedrooms so if i
were doing it myself i'd probably keep
the master bedroom and then the other
four bedrooms i would rent out to
college students this is a really great
way to house hack and i know a lot of
people that have done this successfully
now house hacking is guaranteed to lower
your housing bill
but it might not make it completely free
in high cost of living areas like los
angeles the bay area and new york it's
very very difficult
to house hack your way to a zero dollar
monthly housing payment the housing
costs are just too high here and the
rental rates have not
caught up to the house values at all for
example a 50
000 home in missouri could rent out for
let's say
400 per month so that rental to value
ratio is quite high
on the other hand a 500 000 home in
california will probably rent out for
only 2 500 per month so if you do the
math and compare it to the missouri
the value of the home is 10 times higher
but the rental rate is only about six
times higher now even though you might
not be able to live for free
it's still a heck of a lot better than
just getting your own one bedroom place
and paying a lot of money
for example when i rented out the other
room in my condo i was still paying out
of pocket each and every month but
renting out that room for about 1400
per month meant that i was saving close
to seventeen thousand dollars
per year by choosing to live with a
roommate and the net cost was much lower
than if i had bought
a one-bedroom condo instead of a
two-bedroom condo and rented out that
extra room so really the more bedrooms
the better so if i had bought in like a
bedroom place numbers would have been
even better so keeping all this in mind
after speaking with your lender and real
estate agent the next step is buying
your property
i'm not going to dive deep into this
because you'll learn as you do it and
you'll see that it could take
months to find a property and get your
offer accepted or it could be as quick
as a few weeks but what i recommend
doing is
the moment you get your offer accepted
start thinking about how you're going to
rent out the extra bedroom or the extra
find a good tenant that will make your
life as a landlord easy because if you
don't you're going to really hate your
life you'll want to find out what the
rental rates are in that area and how
much you can realistically charge
if you're renting out a room on airbnb
try to create a separate entrance as
this will make your life a lot easier
and always have a rental agreement in
place for your long-term tenants
even if they are your friends once
you've moved in and started renting out
the tenants you are officially a
landlord you'll collect checks each
month and you'll see
just how big of an impact this has on
your financials
and in case you grow out of that house
or multi-unit you can always sell it
after two years and likely pay
zero capital gains tax on the profit
from that sale now i know that was a lot
of information
but i hope it gave you a clear
background on what house hacking is
and some strategies you can use yourself
to start owning real estate and building
long-term wealth
the key is really to not overthink it
find the property and make sure that the
numbers look good but don't get caught
up so much
in the details what i want you guys to
do is just understand how
amazing house hacking can be and take
action as soon as you can because in the
long term you're going to be really glad
that you did i hope you guys enjoyed the
video as you can probably tell i'm
quite passionate on house hacking and i
really do think that it's such a great
way for anyone
to get into the whole real estate game
real estate is for sure
one of the best ways to build long-term
wealth to build your net worth and
something that i'm really going to be
investing heavily in this year anyways
