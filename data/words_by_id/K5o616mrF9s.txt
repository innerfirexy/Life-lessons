hey guys in this video we are going over
12 commonly purchased items that you are
probably wasting your money on we'll go
through what these 12 things are
how you can save money on them and any
alternatives that you could replace them
with that won't reduce the quality of
your life
i'm huge on saving money and when you
think about how much money you spend
each and every day and on how many
different things it makes sense that
reducing the spending by let's say 20
could save you a tremendous amount of
money when added up over time so let's
get started
first up on my list is brand name
products did you guys know that
americans waste about 44 billion dollars
per year
buying products like clothes food
medicine skincare and so on
just because they are brand name
products i think that's super ridiculous
especially because we have all these
generic brand products that are much
cheaper and
pretty much just as good quality like
seriously a lot of these generic brand
are made in the same factories as the
brand name products according to the
national bureau of economic research
we prefer brand names just mostly
because of misleading ads it's the whole
illusion of
you know if you're spending more money
on something it's gotta be a better
product right well that's not
necessarily true story and generic brand
products are the easiest way to save
money for example if you're trying to
get some medicine
ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse
for the generic name of the product take
a look around your house
see what products you buy and instead of
buying those brand name products
go to your favorite store and find that
store brand product
i guarantee you it's gonna taste exactly
the same it's gonna save you at least a
few bucks and your wallet will be super
happy i pretty much always do this
whenever i hit the grocery store
i don't look at brand name products i
always look at the store brand or
generic brand products and yeah
seriously you cannot tell a difference
the only difference you can tell is that
you are saving money all right number
two on my list is
coffee and most people get their daily
drink from starbucks or dunkin donuts or
something like that let's say your
normal order at starbucks is five
dollars and you go there seven days a
week well in a week that's 35
pretty much wasted on this coffee and if
you look at it over a whole year that's
a whopping 1825
and if you get like a croissant or a
muffin or something like that your order
up and you spend way more than that and
i know that the average american coffee
drinker drinks
over three cups per day and guys it
doesn't seem like much when you're at
starbucks and you're just spending five
but it really adds up so while it is
tempting to just be able to go to
starbucks and have someone else make
your drink for you
it's not exactly easy on your pocket
instead save yourself a lot of money and
invest in a coffee maker they really
ease the workload you don't have to
drive to starbucks and you can make
really good coffee straight from your
home now i'm not saying like never get
starbucks that's definitely something
you can do
but just think about it as a habit right
you don't want to make going
starbucks and dropping five dollars on a
single cup of coffee
a daily habit make it maybe once or
twice a week thing cutting back on
spending money at starbucks or other
coffee shops will save you a lot of
in the long run alright my number three
thing that you guys might be wasting
your money on is
paying rent for a space that's too
luxurious or too big
now according to business insider
experts aren't fond of investing in
properties that are too lavish
or too big thanks to technology and also
thanks to minimalism honestly we need a
lot less space than we did before
families are shrinking delivery services
mean that we don't have to cook
necessarily as much there's less
paperwork to store because everything is
online these days
ebooks have erased the necessity to have
big bookshelves in your house and yet
having a yard is incredibly hard and
takes a lot of time to maintain so
really when you think about having a big
think about all the extra work that goes
into having a big house and think about
all the days you're working to pay for
that more expensive mortgage or rental
payment that is pretty much just
throwing money away buying these
needlessly big and luxurious homes
is simply a waste of money for most
people having a smaller space means it's
easier to clean you need
less furniture and overall your life
will just be less stressful and most
importantly you won't be a slave to your
higher monthly payment alright number
four on my list
is full price groceries my biggest hack
for buying cheap groceries is to only
buy things that are on sale i bet you
that 90
of the things that you want to buy will
be on sale or at least some variant of
it the key is just to be very flexible
and not be brand specific for example if
you're trying to buy a type of meat
don't go in with a certain meat in mind
just go in and find what's on sale and
buy that meat for the week or go to the
pros section with an open mind and just
look for the produce that is on sale
that week the more flexible you are with
your groceries
the more amount of money you can save
this works mostly at places like
vaughn's or ralph's or albertsons but it
doesn't really work for places like
trader joe's that don't really have
i mean trader joe's has pretty good
prices and it's extremely convenient
not to look for things on sale but
overall if you want to spend less money
and you are
down to take that extra time to just
find things that are on sale big stores
such as vons or ralph's that's where you
want to shop and you guys i know you can
over a thousand dollars per year when
you just buy things on sale
this is how i've been doing my grocery
shopping for the last like
10 or so years all right number five on
my list is buying internet that is just
way too fast now i know when you sign up
for internet they normally present you
with at least a few options it's always
tempting to go with the fastest one
because you see something like 1000
megabits per second versus
let's say 300 megabits per second and
you're like whoa the 1001 must be way
faster well the truth is
for most people i'm talking like at
least 95
of people you absolutely do not need the
fastest internet unless you're uploading
huge video files or streaming netflix on
like 10 different computers at once the
highest grade internet is just going to
be overkill
now it also depends on where you live
because different areas have
different services and the max speed for
the internet might vary from place to
place so right now i do have
300 megabits per second internet and
when i was signing up for internet
18t was like hey we have 300 we also
have 1 000.
i chose 300 because i want to save some
money and you guys i can upload a
youtube video in about
30 seconds so look at what you do with
your internet and if it's not something
crazy like
uploading thousands and thousands of
gigabytes of files per day or per month
then just go with the cheaper one you'll
save easily 20
per month and yeah that's a very easy
way to save money all right number six
on my list
is extended warranties stanford
university experts in 2018 agreed that
extended warranties are just not worth
the cost
today's appliances are generally
reliable enough where you don't need to
the extended warranty option extended
warranty periods are generally for
about one to two years past the original
warranty date and the truth is that
appliances they mostly will not break
down in that time period and even if
they do
it's possible that the repair costs are
still cheaper than the warranty cost the
only thing that's good about these
warranties is if something
catastrophic happens like your car
engine explodes this prevents you from
getting hit with a huge bill
and spreads that payment over months and
yeah that's probably the best thing
about these types of warranties
they offer you that peace of mind what i
recommend is just buying high quality
from generous retailers for example
costco has a very generous return policy
i'm not saying to take advantage of that
but i am saying just look for these
retailers that
are a little bit more flexible in the
returns and to be extra safe use a
credit card with an extended warranty
automatically built in with that you
should not need an extended warranty all
right number seven is
streaming services now i will say that
streaming services they are way better
than paying for
the old-school cable however there are
so many different streaming services
available now for example
netflix youtube premium hulu disney plus
where like if you sign up for all of
these then you're gonna be spending a
lot of money per month that isn't
necessary here's my advice
so test out all the streaming services
that you are thinking about getting and
the top two
those are the ones that you should get i
know that it's getting a little bit
harder because a lot of these streaming
they have original content that you
don't want to miss out on but come on
guys you
probably know someone that has a netflix
account who can share with you so
just do that right now the only two
streaming services that i pay for
are netflix and youtube premium and
that's because that's where 99 of the
content i watch is
figure out which two are the most useful
and then just cancel out the other
streaming services it's going to save
you money but it's also going to save
you time because
you know watching tv it's not the best
use of your time
and you can spend it doing a lot more
productive things all right number eight
on my list
is full price clothing i know that when
most stores release their brand new
for the season those products aren't
gonna be on sale and they're gonna be
selling for full price now there are two
ways that you can do this you can just
wait for those prices to go down
once that season's over or you can
simply just buy less clothes i know a
lot of people
waste so much money buying tons and tons
of clothes they'll wear it maybe a few
times and then just
sell it or get rid of it if you're
paying for full price clothes then just
know that you're
paying that extra price for that trendy
new look those clothes will go on sale
in a few months and chances are you'll
be able to pick it up for at least
50 off now the first thing i do when i
go into a clothing store is
i head straight to the sales section if
there's nothing there then i will
browse the full price stuff but i will
say that 90
of the clothes i buy are on sale it's
very rare for me to
pay full price for clothing i just don't
think it's needed so in this section i'm
buy clothes that were on sale or just
don't buy as much clothes
this could potentially save you hundreds
or thousands of dollars per year number
nine on my list is
car insurance now buying car insurance
it's very similar to buying a car
you have to shop around it's crazy but
every different insurance provider is
gonna give you
a very different quote like i guarantee
you if you get quotes from at least five
different insurance carriers the range
from the cheapest one to the most
expensive one
is going to be at least a few hundred
dollars per year you can save
hundreds of dollars per year just simply
by shopping around
when finding car insurance and if you
think it's not worth your time to
actually go out and get multiple quotes
there are services that can do that for
a lot of people actually never switch
their car insurance or they just don't
switch enough because they think it's
too big of a hassle but honestly you
guys it's not a big hassle
in fact i just switched insurance
carriers for my car
and i'm saving about 500 per year for
the same
exact coverage this literally only took
about 30 minutes of my time
and most of that time was spent just
being on hold so definitely worth the
time investment
if you ask me all right number 10 on my
list is buying bottled water this is a
pretty obvious one but it's pretty crazy
because the average american spends
17 and 47 cents per month on bottled
water that's a dollar 22 cents
per gallon which is about 800 times more
than just normal tap water this is a
super easy fix all you have to do is buy
a brita or
pure water filter system and that's
going to replace thousands and thousands
of these
really wasteful water bottles it's going
to save you a lot of money it's going to
save you time and actually going out to
buy that water and lastly it is way
better for the environment all right
number 11 is
late fees and interest payments did you
guys know that one in three americans
late in paying a medical utility or
credit card bill this can not only lead
to negative consequences such as for
getting your utilities cut off but it
can also lead to increased
interest payments as well as affecting
your credit score the average credit
card holder is about seven
thousand dollars in credit debt and if
they're only making minimum payments
they'll be subject to about the 20
interest rate
on the remaining balance and as a result
they end up paying
thousands and thousands of dollars per
year in interest this is easily
avoidable by
paying your bills on time or just
spending what you're able to afford
and according to the commercial
financial bureau policies credit card
companies can charge as much as 30
for your first violation the easiest
method to avoid
any of this stuff is to just enroll in
autopay the instant you get a credit
card or the instant you have a bill
you have to make sure to pay that off
sorry for the change in scenery i
accidentally deleted that last clip so i
have to refill it right now another way
to stay on top of your finances is to
organized and right now there are so
many great apps that can help you stay
organized with your life and your
finances for example
mints which is one that i use and
there's also productivity apps
such as asana and notion that help you
track every aspect of your life these
apps can help you stay on top of your
game and know
what is due and when it is due because
the last thing you want to do is to miss
a payment just because you forgot to
sign up for auto pay all right number 12
the last one on this list
is atm fees atm fees on average can go
up to a whopping
five dollars per transaction and
especially if you're not using your own
bank's atm this is entirely
avoidable i think almost everyone
watching this video either has a bank of
chase or wells fargo account if you do
only use those atms because they won't
charge you a fee another way is to go
cashless and this is becoming more
with the pandemic also if you bank with
certain online banks such as ally
they will actually reimburse you for
your atm fees so definitely look for
perks like that when you are signing up
for a bank account
it just really doesn't make any sense
for you to pay money to
get your money out it's just a waste and
there are a lot of ways around that so
hope you guys found this video helpful
you know all these small purchases
they might seem quite small at five
dollars or something like that
but they really do add up when you're
spending five dollars here and there
every day
for months for years it really compounds
and these are just really generally bad
habits that you should be letting go of
the more money you save now
means the more money you can invest and
when you invest more that means more of
your money is working for you so
definitely recommend if some of these 12
things are things that you are paying
take a look see what you can cut out and
i guarantee you you're going to save
or thousands of dollars per year if you
