a lot of actors want to know how to get
experience especially when you're just
getting started and you don't have an
agent and you don't have other people
helping you find auditions
how do you get experience how do you add
credits to your resume and add footage
to your demo reel
well that's exactly what we are going to
be talking about today let's get started
what's up my fellow actors welcome to

things get busy and i'm not able to post
every week
especially this month this has been the
busiest acting month
of my career personally i'm currently
working on
two movies and recurring on a netflix
show so it's been super busy
i've had to step away from doing youtube
videos for a little bit
however the good news is that i'm
learning every time i'm on set right so
i'm learning new things that i will be
able to share with you
once those projects come out so i'll be
able to share more
with you in these youtube videos in this
video we are talking about
how to gain experience as an actor
specifically i'm going to
show you 10 ways to gain experience as
actor because nobody starts with acting
experience we all start
from the bottom right and we slowly work
our way up
so in this video we're going to talk
about how to get started and how to gain
experience so that we can
start moving forward in our careers all
first of all let me welcome those of you
who are brand new if this is your first
time watching one of my videos

television shows
including the three projects that i'm

this month alright so if you want to
download that for free get it from that
right up there okay let's talk about how
to get acting experience
first let me say that there are some
people out there not everybody but there
are some people out there that think
they can have zero experience and then
immediately start acting in a marvel
movie or a major netflix show
and it just doesn't work that way it's
very unlikely that someone with
absolutely no experience
can immediately get into a major
blockbuster movie
or hit television show that's kind of
saying someone with no basketball
can just immediately play for the los
angeles lakers
seems very unlikely right and in many
respects acting is the same way
it's very unlikely someone with no
experience can get to the
top level shows immediately they have to
work their way up
just like a basketball player has to
work their way up
to get to the point where they're
playing in the nba so
that's why we're talking about getting
experience in this video how do we start
gaining experience and get to the point
where you have
the resume and the demo reel and the
to start auditioning for the major
movies and the bigger roles and all of
those things okay so in this video we're
talking about the
10 ways to gain experience as an
actor all right so way number one is
to start doing plays in school
for those of you who are still in school
middle school high school
even college a lot of those places may
drama club may have school plays
anything like this where you can start
getting involved and getting on stage
acting that is great experience
especially when you're younger just
getting started
is the most important thing and i know a
lot of people might be
a lot of especially the people that are
watching my channel are not really
interested in theater
many people aren't many of you may only
be interested in film and tv
but understand that theater acting
is also acting and a lot of the people
in the industry agents casting directors
directors producers a lot of them put a
lot of value
on actors who have theater experience
look at some of the oscar-winning actors
of today
the emmy-winning actors of today a lot
of them came from a theater background
many of them have
theater experience in their background
and then they translated that into their
on-camera careers
so because of that you see a lot of
agents that put a lot of value
on acting in theater and
and and seeing that on a resume so if
you're just getting started
and you have the opportunity to act in a
school play to get involved in drama
to take theater classes in college where
whatever it may be
that those can be great ways to start
involved and getting your feet wet and
getting your first little bit
of experience in acting the second way
get experience in acting is especially
if you're outside
if you've graduated from school already
if you're attending a school who that
doesn't have
a drama club or doesn't have school
plays or doesn't have anything that you
can get involved in with acting
then you can look for private acting
outside of school many cities have
private acting teachers private acting
studios that you could take classes
either after school or on the weekends
or whenever they
offer the classes those those
classes often offer
they may put on plays in the class they
may put on
performance nights where they do a
showcase for
for their actors and that is again
experience where you
get a chance to act and get a chance to
perform in front of an audience
this all adds to your experience as an
actor a third way to get experience
again kind of
in the theater realm is doing community
many city many cities and towns have
community theater where you can get
involved and audition for
plays in the community this obviously is
broadway this isn't the big shows that
you see in new york and the shows that
around the country around the world
these are small plays that are done
in a community lower budget you're
probably not going to be paid for these
but you get a chance again to gain
experience it's a
something to put on your resume it's
something it's a way
to start getting involved and getting a
chance to perform for the first time or
the first few times in your career
now in addition to on stage experience
there are ways to get your first few
credits of on camera experience as well
one of the best ways that i have seen
throughout my career for myself and for
other actors is getting involved in
student films
student films are exactly what they
sound like they are films made by
students student filmmakers many
colleges and universities even community
colleges especially here in the us
i don't know what it's like in other
countries but the colleges and
often offer a filmmaking program and
these are
programs for future directors future
producers future cinematographers
the people that work behind the camera
to make the movie right
when these students are taking these
they're going to need to make movies
throughout their
courses and they will have to cast
actors for their student films
so this is a great opportunity for
aspiring actors who are just getting
started to potentially audition for
these student films
now it's it's clear that these are not
blockbuster movies and they're not major
television shows
however these are the first few steps
that you take
right so if you have nothing on your
and you have no acting experience this
is a great way to kind of just get your
feet wet to get your
first time on camera and get in front of
the camera and act for the first time
so if you're interested in doing these
types of student films i'd
recommend you research universities and
colleges in your area and look up if
they have
film programs and if they do have a film
look up that particular department and
check out their website and see if
there's a
something posted on their website of how
to audition for
the student film programs when they are
their movies throughout the year or
throughout the semester
so that's a great way to get started a
second way to get started in
doing on camera work is doing
lower budget independent films again
understanding that we're not starting
in the big blockbuster realm but doing
some of these smaller
lower budget things i've done a ton of
these in my career when i first started
making movies where it's just the people
around town who
are trying to you know directors who are
trying to get their careers off the
ground producers who are trying to get
their careers off the ground
just the same way as we are as actors
finding those types of people in your
and seeing if they're trying to make a
short film or to try to make an
independent film
and audition for those types of projects
many cities especially the bigger cities
the us and i'm sure in many other
countries as well we'll have
filmmaking communities and see if you
can get involved there may be social
uh facebook groups and things like that
where you can connect with people and
see if those
opportunities are out there to audition
for those types of projects but
again independent films short films
those types of things are great to start
getting your career started
in the on camera acting realm one fun
way to start getting involved in
independent films and short films
is doing film competitions now there are
tons of film competitions
international competitions national
all over the world and there's no way i
can mention all of them here
but i just want to give you one example
and it's a popular one and that is the
48 hour film project
i've done tons of 48 hour films you can
go to their website 48hourfilm.com i'll
put a link down in the description below
and check out if they do something in
your city or maybe in a city
close to you the premise of the 48 hour
film project
is that it is a film competition that's
timed and you have 48 hours to
write shoot edit and basically complete
a four to seven minute long
film and have and submit it for judging
and hopefully try to win the competition
but again it's not about winning the
competition it's about getting involved
and having fun and getting your feet wet
and starting to
get your first on-camera acting
like i said i've done a bunch of these
when i first started in my career
and the 48-hour film project goes to
different cities around the world
and holds these competitions so like i
said you could check out their website
and see if they go to your city or maybe
a city nearby
that you can go and audition for one of
the teams that are competing
uh in the 48 hour film competition okay
so far everything that we've talked
are projects that will probably not pay
you any money
uh community theater student films
school plays like these types of things
are not going to pay you any money
sometimes independent films may pay a
little bit but
for the most part you're not going to be
making a lot of money doing these
projects however they are still very
important to the beginning of every
actor's career
because these are the first small steps
that we have to take in order
to be able to take the big steps in the
okay but now let me talk about a couple
ways to gain experience and
also make money number one is
a lot of actors that start out don't
even think about commercials
as a way of acting they only think about
theater and movies and tv shows but
commercials is actually one of the ways
many actors make a living there are a
lot of actors who
provide for themselves and for their
families by just doing commercials
so it's a great way to get started to
gain experience to start acting in front
of the camera
and i'll say this too let me just use
myself and
as an example when i first got started
in cleveland ohio
there were not many movies being made in
our region and definitely no tv shows
so when i got started i was really just
commercial type work and when i moved
down to atlanta
my commercial experience my commercial
acting experience helped me
get my agent in atlanta so when i was
trying to get my agent and i wanted to
become a tv and movie actor even though
i had never been in a tv show before
my agent was still impressed with all of
my commercial experience and that's the
reason that they signed me
so don't discount being in commercials
and acting in this type of work even if
your future goals are to become
an actor in film and tv so commercials
is one option a second option for acting
on camera and maybe making some money
along the way
is corporate industrial videos or
corporate training videos
what these types of videos are similar
to commercials they're
acting for a company a company is using
it a business
is using it but whereas a commercial
will be outward facing it's
uh it's something that's broadcast on tv
or on the internet
a corporate video or an industrial video
is usually used internally
it's used by a company or by a business
for their internal use and the most
common example is a training video
so when an employee gets hired by a
a lot of times the companies will show
them a training video of how to do their
well those training videos hire actors
demonstrate or to perform the jobs in
the videos to teach those
employees so commercials industrial
videos these are two ways to
again gain experience as an actor but
also could potentially
make you a little bit of money at the
same time now let me pause here for a
second and talk about how
you can find these opportunities because
we don't want to just talk about you
know how to gain experience but
where do you actually find these
opportunities to audition for plays and
to audition for
student films and independent films and
commercials and industrial videos
in the united states if you don't have
an agent or you don't have somebody else
helping you find auditions you as an
individual can find auditions off of
casting websites like backstage
like actors access like casting networks
these in my opinion are the three
biggest ones here in the us
i don't know what it's like in other
countries and what casting platforms are
used in other countries
so you may have to do your own research
on that but if you are in the us
backstage actors access casting networks
are websites that i recommend you sign
up for
and start looking for auditions on those
platforms there are
other platforms as well other websites
as well but i think those three are
great way
to get started now that being said let
me back off for a second
and say that there are many
opportunities out there
that will require you to get an agent
those will not
post on public websites like actors
access and casting networks and things
like that
however if you're getting started you
don't have an agent yet these are a
great way to get started
and start auditioning for the projects
that are posted there
there you will find commercials on there
you will find industrial videos and
student films and short films and
theater and all kinds of stuff
uh independent films on those types of
websites so
i highly encourage you to get onto those
websites and start submitting yourself
and start
getting involved and getting your first
few credits
and experience that way okay the ninth
way to gain experience as an
actor the penultimate item on my list
is to create your own content
some people will say that this should be
number one on my list why because we
have complete control
over this one why wait for
other people to cast us in a project
when we can just cast ourselves
why not write your own script write your
own screenplay write your own short film
whatever it is
and cast yourself as the main character
and film it yourself
this is your most powerful tool
right now almost everybody has a phone
with an hd camera these days
so there are people that have won film
competitions by simply recording
something with their phone
so cast yourself create your own content
i've done tons of this when i was just
getting started the best way to do this
honestly is with other students in your
acting class
get together with some other actors and
create your own film on a weekend
it's kind of like the 48 hour film
project that we talked about
prior but instead of again instead of
waiting for a competition to come around
why not do this
on your own create your own film uh by
and get experience that way by doing
that you're not only
not only are you learning how to act
on camera but you're also learning how
to put a film together how to produce a
so this is a great way to gain
experience and you don't have to wait
for anybody else to do it
you can create your own experience you
can create your own footage
you can create your own credit to put on
your resume it's a win-win
in all areas the tenth and final way to
get experience
as an actor is a little bit different
the other nine that we've talked about
everything you do for experience has to
acting in fact i highly encourage
everyone who is trying to pursue an
acting career
to also try to get experience on the
other side of the camera
behind the camera anything that you can
do even if it's just being a production
assistant and helping out
helping out a producer or a director
in making their film you get to learn so
much about the filmmaking process so if
you can be a production assistant if you
can help with sound help with lighting
help with just the camera or anything or
even helping a casting director in a
casting session
to see how the whole casting process
works all of this can help you
learn about the process of making a
movie and that can help you as an actor
even though it isn't directly acting
okay those were 10 ways to gain
experience as an actor when you're just
getting started and you don't have an
agent i hope this video was helpful for
