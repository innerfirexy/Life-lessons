what's up my fellow actors curt you here
from actingcareercenter.com
hey we're in my hotel room again because
i'm still working on that project that i
mentioned in last week's video i'm
having a lot of fun working on this
can't wait for it to come out so i can
share it with all of you guys
now before we get into today's topic i
actually do want to mention one other
from the video from last week uh if you
the topic of last week's video is what
happens when an actor gets
their scenes cut from a movie or a
television show and i shared a couple
examples of times when my scenes were
cut from movies and shows
and as soon as i posted that video last
week i got a lot of
questions in the comments a lot of the
same question in the comments
and uh i should have seen this question
coming i should have addressed it in the
video and that was my
fault because it's a very good question
the question was
when an actor gets their scenes cut from
a project do they still get paid and the
answer is
yes and no so let me explain when you
work on a project whether it's a movie
or a tv
show or commercial the days that i work
on set
i get paid for no matter what and
usually that check if it's especially if
it's a union project that check's gonna
come in like two to three weeks max
you're gonna get that check pretty
pretty soon and you get paid
for working those days no matter what
whether you get cut or not
and now let's say the movie comes out
like six months from now or a year from
when that movie comes out and i go watch
that movie and i look for my scenes and
my scenes were cut
well that means that if such a movie
has residuals which most union
in the united states movies and tv shows
and commercials
those projects will have residuals and
the residual payments do not get paid to
anybody who was cut from the project i
could do a whole other video on what
residual payments are but in a nutshell
residual payments are payments that you
get in addition to what you got paid for
your days that you worked on set
and the payments are for future uses
of the project so when a person buys a
dvd so if somebody buys a dvd of a
project that i was in
then like i get a few pennies but if
thousands of people buy those dvds it
all kind of adds up to future residual
payments and now obviously
dvds are kind of a thing of the past but
if people buy the movie video on demand
or if a streaming service uh picks up
the movie to show for a period of time
all of that ends up going to the
production company and the production
company disperses it to
all the people that get residuals now if
you were an actor in the movie and your
scenes were in the movie
then you get those residual payments but
if your scenes were cut and you're no
longer in the movie
or a tv show whatever it is then you do
not get those residual payments so
that's the answer to that question when
your scenes get cut you still get paid
for the days that you work
but you don't get the future payments in
residuals okay let's move on to today's
topic which
are acting career regrets and i thought
doing this topic and i didn't know if i
should do it because i'm not really like
way down i'm not like in my 70s or 80s i
don't have a
huge long career yet but i still feel
like there are some things i can talk
about in the
amount of time that i have been working
in the industry and the things that i
may or may not regret doing
one of the questions that i get a lot
whether it's comments on my youtube
channel or just people asking me in
is do you regret not starting your
career earlier
if you are a follower of my channel or
if you just happen to know me you may
have heard me tell the story of how i
got started and i started at the age of
26 i didn't do any acting before i was
26 years old so i started
relatively late compared to i guess a
lot of people right
and so people have asked me you know do
you regret not starting like five years
earlier or 10 years earlier or 15 years
earlier right what if
you started what if you started when you
were 20 or or 15 or
10 years old um wouldn't you be like
15 years ahead in your career right now
if you had started that
that young and i guess it's possible
right but but nobody can really
predict like what would have happened
had i done something differently
but my answer actually is no i do not
starting at the age of 26 i actually
really like the fact that i started at
that age
for a few reasons number one
had i started younger had i started like
as a teenager or as like a 12 year old
i'm not 100 sure i would have had the
the mental toughness to handle this
industry because
to be honest this is a really tough
career to pursue and it takes
it takes mental strength it takes thick
and it takes patience for sure and those
are three traits that i don't think i
when i was a younger kid even in my
teenage years or early 20s i don't think
i had
those traits quite yet and i feel like
not that at 26 i was
really good at that but i do feel like i
was better at all of those things than i
when i was younger so who knows what
would have happened had i started at a
younger age
because it's possible i think
it's very possible that if i started at
14 and i went on 20 auditions and i
didn't book any of them
there's a very real possibility that 14
year old curt would have been like
this sucks i must be a terrible actor
this career is terrible i go on 14
audition or i go on 20 auditions and i
don't even book them
i must be terrible i quit that that
very well could have happened i might
have quit
my acting career entirely at a young age
because i didn't have the mental
strength or
the patience or the thick skin to deal
with all that but starting a little bit
later in my life as an adult
i had those traits a little bit more
ingrained in me
and i was able to kind of push through
all that to continue so that as a 26
year old 27
28 as i continue to
grow in my career and if i went on 20
auditions and
didn't book any of them i was okay with
it and i knew that this was all part of
the process but i think as teenagers or
young kids we're so impatient we want
things right away and when things don't
come we tend to just quit
and that very well may have happened to
me so that's why i have
no regrets of starting at the age that i
did and this actually is a lesson that i
every young actor should take to heart
is that this
is a marathon not a sprint you've
probably heard a lot of people
say it that way and that we have to have
patience in this career and if you don't
have that patience you're very likely to
earlier than you should not that you
ever should but a lot of actors
young actors especially they quit
because they feel like oh i'm not my
career is not going anywhere
after only doing it for a couple years
when it when in reality
it takes a long time much longer than a
couple years to build an acting career
so the next question that i get
sometimes is
do you regret not doing more theater
when you first started and this i
absolutely do regret when i first
my acting classes in cleveland ohio and
i was just
getting my first few lessons and acting
just learning how to do everything i
should have done more theater i should
have auditioned for theater and
hopefully i would have been cast in a
play here or there
and done it and this is not like doing
anything for money this is
a lot of community theater most of it is
but i should have done it for the
experience and i should have done it for
the training and i should have done it
to become a better actor
the reason i say that is this i've
gotten a chance to work on a lot of
movies and tv shows now and i've gotten
a chance to work with a lot of actors
and it always seems to be the case that
the actors with
a theater background who have done some
theater in their past
always seems to be the better actors on
set because they have that experience
and they have that training
and theater just i mean it simply makes
people better actors and i should have
realized this when i was just getting
started in my career but i was kind of
like tunnel vision focused on i want to
be an on-camera actor and i think there
are a lot of actors out there that are
like that
who really have no interest in doing
theater they want to be
on tv and they want to be in movies but
i think it's really important to
understand that theater acting is
a great training ground for your future
as a film and television actor you see a
lot of the oscar-winning and emmy
winning actors nowadays a lot of them
almost all of them
have a theater background and that's
what made them into the great actors
that they are today
so i really do that is one of my regrets
i wish i would have done
much more theater when i was just
getting started
and and it's a fair question that a lot
of people will then ask is well why
don't you just do more theater now
and that's a tough thing right now
because i am working so much in film and
and unfortunately theater just does not
pay as much it's the truth that theater
doesn't pay as well as film and
and it's harder for me now to accept a
theater job
because that takes away from me
auditioning for
film and tv for the for the run of the
and uh when i was just getting started i
wasn't auditioning for film and tv so it
doesn't matter if i took a theater job
that was the time to do it so i feel
like for those of you who are
new who are just getting started if you
get the opportunity to do theater
even if your future goals do not include
theater even if your future goals really
include film and tv i highly encourage
you to do it because
it can provide extremely valuable
training for your film and tv career
and it it will honestly it will make you
a better actor
do i regret moving to atlanta instead of
la for my acting career absolutely not
this is an easy question to answer i'm
happy with my decision to move to
atlanta for numerous reasons number one
i'm able to afford to live
in a place that is not a tiny little
apartment because i know
based on my budget of what i could
afford in atlanta when i was looking at
it would have had to be a much much
smaller place because la is so
expensive to live in uh the other reason
is that
it really blows my mind to see how far
my career has come in the last five
years that i've lived in atlanta
would i have had the same amount of
success in la
possibly but i somehow i doubt it
somehow i
doubt i could have done what i've been
able to do in atlanta
had i gone to la if anything it would
have taken a little bit longer i think
because i was able to get my agent in
atlanta almost immediately
and in la i know i know from experiences
of friends that have moved out there
just getting their first agent getting
their first auditions
that tends to take a long time to build
up that momentum
and i kind of just hit the ground
running right away here in atlanta so
for those reasons i have zero regrets
for where i moved
i know la is kind of the mecca of the
acting world
but um atlanta's grown a ton in atlanta
has become a huge huge film and
television production hub
and the projects that are filming in
atlanta are amazing
i've had chances to work on and audition
for some amazing projects so
i have no regrets for coming to atlanta
do i regret
studying computer science in college
instead of studying
acting or theater and this kind of goes
back to the original question of
do i regret not starting my acting
career earlier
and the answer is kind of the same i i
don't regret that at all i
don't regret studying computer science
in fact
i think it really helped me in terms of
my acting career because
from a financial standpoint i already
had my full-time job when i
started pursuing acting when i first
started taking acting classes
so i didn't really have the financial
of finding trying to figure out how i'm
going to pay for acting classes how i'm
going to pay for headshots how am i
going to survive when acting's not
paying me any money
because i had my full-time job already i
was financially stable with my other
and i could kind of leisurely pursue
at whatever pace i wanted to do and
there wasn't the pressure
of oh i gotta book this acting job
because i need the money from it
right and and because of that taking
that pressure away
from me allowed me to kind of pursue it
a little bit more freely
and so that's why i think studying
computer science in college
then getting that full-time job and
working in the corporate world and
becoming financially stable before
starting on my
acting career i'm super happy that that
was the path that my career took
obviously that's not everybody's career
path but um
for me that's how it ended up happening
and i have no regrets
okay that's it for this video those were
my acting career regrets slash
