- So I recently bit the bullet
and did the standard Youtuber thing
of getting a brand new Tesla Model 3
And so in this video I wanna explain to you
and more importantly to my mum who's watching
why this wasn't just a massive flex
and why I think it was actually
a pretty reasonable financial decision
So I bought the car in July 2020
and I ordered it online which was a very nice experience
The base price of the Standard Edition is 40,490 pounds
but I went for the Long Range model
which was 46,990 pounds
and then added the white to premium interior
and the blue paint for the exterior
that was 1000 pounds each
So adding an extra 2000 pounds
brought up the cost of 48,990
which when you take the insurance into account
which is about 1000 pounds
leads us to a total cost of the car of around 50,000 pounds
But this 50k isn't what the car actually cost to me
it actually costs less than half of that
and let's break down why
So when you have a business
you've got this concept of writing off business expenses
which is a term you might have heard of before
Basically what it means is that
if you're buying something purely for business use
then you can take the cost of it out of the business
rather than out of your own personal bank account
So if you've got a business
and you buy something that's exclusively for business use
what you can do is you can write it off
as a business expense
which means the cost of the item
doesn't count as your profit because it's an expense
and therefore you don't have to pay
any corporation tax on it
In the UK corporation tax is 19% at the moment
So let's say your business makes 100,000 pounds
in profit for the year 19% of that goes to the government
so you pay 19,000 pounds and corporation tax
But let's say I wanted to buy something
like a Tesla Model 3 for the business
that would be 50,000 pounds
And so it would reduce the overall profit of the business
down to 50,000
I still pay 19% corporation tax on the remainder
so I'd be paying 9500
But my total corporation tax bill
is 19% less than the cost of the vehicle
So I'm paying 9500 pounds less corporation tax
because this counts as a business expense
And so if we think about this 9500 pounds of tax
that we're saving in the end this 50,000 pound car
actually only ends up costing my business 40,500
because of the corporation tax saving
but that begs the question of
is it actually legit to write off a car
as a business expense
So if you wanna write something off as a business expense
the rule is that it has to be wholly
and exclusively used for the business
and any personal use is insignificant or incidental
So if you're a YouTuber
and you're buying a camera for example
that's very easy to justify as a business expense
because obviously you're using that mostly for business use
but it would be a lot harder for me to justify for a car
especially because this business
doesn't require me to travel all that much
So in the UK if you buy stuff as a business
but then there is some personal use as well
that gets a special tax code Benefit in Kind
And it's like the government thinks
that you're being paid the value of the thing
that your business bought you
and therefore you kinda get income tax on that amount
And so if this were a normal car
that would be quite a lot of tax
I would have to pay every year
for using it for personal reasons
And often that would mean that it's actually not worth
buying a car as a business expense
But crucially in April 2020 the new budget
which the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets out every year
said that specifically fully electric cars
are exempt from benefit in kind tax
And so the benefit in kind tax rate for this car
is zero percent
which means I can buy it as a business
and I can use it personally however much I want
and I won't have to pay any extra tax
And the reason they've done this
is because in the UK over half of the cars that are bought
are bought by businesses
And so the government's realized
that if they incentivize people to buy electric cars
by reducing the tax rates that means overall
more cars in the UK will become electric
and that will be good for the environment in the long term
So currently the car's costing 40,500 pounds
because of the corporation tax saving
but there's still a few more discounts
we can add to the price of the car
So if you're a business owner
and you wanna take money out of your business
usually the best way of doing that
is by something called dividends
The problem is that like everything else in life
dividends also get taxed
And so in England if you're a higher rate taxpayer
i.e you own more than 37,500 pounds a year which I do
then your dividend tax rate is 32.5%
So let's say I want us to take out
10,000 pounds in dividends
I'd be paying 3250 to the government as dividend tax
and that would leave me with 6750
Now this is very relevant to Tesla discussion
because the Tesla costs 50,000 pounds
and the alternative you not buying the car
and taking out cash instead
means that I'd be taking out that 50,000 pounds
as a dividend
So firstly because that 50,000 pounds is profit
it means it's taxed at 19% for corporation tax
which takes it down to 40,500
And then I take that 40,500 out as a dividend
which means it's gonna be taxed at 32.5%
That means I have to pay 13,162 pounds
to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs
which leaves me with 27,337 pounds and 50p
So thanks to corporation tax first and dividend tax second
this 50,000 that I've tried to take out of the business
has gone down to just over 27,000 pounds
but that's still not the end of the story
We also have to take student loans into account
So I spent six years at university studying medicine
if you didn't know
and so my student loan has gone up to about 60,000 pounds
that I still have to repay
And because the system is quite nice in the UK
you only pay a certain percentage
of any amount you earn above around 20,000 pounds
And so I've gotta pay 9%
of everything that I earn above a certain threshold
to the student loans company
So if I wanna take out the price of this car as a dividend
first it goes down from 50K to 27.3K
thanks to corporation tax and dividend tax
And then I pay another 9% of the student loans company
which takes it down to 24,877
So putting it all together
let's think about these two scenarios
Number one buying the Tesla Model 3
and number two
taking out that 50,000 pounds in cash instead
if I buy the Tesla Model 3 for 50,000
it ends up costing my business 40,500
and I get a Tesla that I can ride whenever I want
But if instead of trying to take that 50,000 pounds
in cash instead it gets whittled down by corporation tax
the dividend tax and student loan repayments
to around 24,000 pounds
And so in a way I'm getting this 50,000 pounds car
for around 24,000 which is less than half price
and personally I will be more than happy
to pay 24 grand for a brand new Tesla Model 3
And this whole thing about business expenses
is one of the reasons why having your own business
is such a powerful thing
because especially if you're a solopreneur or a creator
or an internet entrepreneur
most of the stuff that you're gonna buy
for business purposes is actually gonna be tech
and so you can afford a fancy ass camera
or a fancy ass MacBook or like a super widescreen monitor
Because effectively you're getting all of this stuff
at half price or less
If you found this interesting
and you're potentially interested
in starting your own business
here is a video called "How To Make Money Online"
like the three levels of making money online
where I explain how I got started
with making money on the internet
and how you can do the same
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
Bye bye
