how do actors make money well if you're
a big-time hollywood celebrity you're
negotiating multi-million dollar deals
for your blockbuster movies or your hit
television shows
but if you're one of the other 99 of
actors who are not at that level
yet how do those actors make money in
their careers
well in this video i want to share with
you 10 different ways that actors make
money in this industry
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television industry
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for

if this is your first time here make

today we're talking about different ways
that actors make money within this
industry because like i said before
unless you are a big time celebrity you
are not rich and famous
most actors are not rich and famous and
a corporate job where you're getting a
steady paycheck every week or every
other week
actors usually don't know where the next
paycheck is coming from so we're always
on the lookout
of how we can make money in our careers
now i've talked about actor finances
before in a previous video where we
discussed how actors make money
outside of the industry with their
survival jobs
and their side hustles and if you're
interested in that video i'll put a link
to it down in the description below but
in today's video we're talking about 10
different ways that actors make money
within the industry itself how we make
money by actually performing
and getting paid for it so let's get
right to it the first way that we are
going to discuss is what most people
already know about and that is
acting in movies and television shows
when you're just getting started in your
career you are most likely not getting
roles in major movies or television
shows and that's because
productions are looking for someone who
they can trust
who has a strong resume and a body of
work that can back up
being cast in that type of role so when
you're first getting started you are
most likely only getting a chance
to get a role that is a small supporting
role where you're on set for maybe a day
or two but these types of roles on
movies and shows are
great for your career because not only
are they a credit for your resume
and their footage that you can add to
your demo reel but you also get
paid for it and in the united states the
major movies and television shows are
under a sag-aftra union contract and
what that means
is that there is a minimum base pay that
is pre-negotiated for every time that
you are on set right now in 2020 the
base pay for a sag after a full budget
is about 1 000 per day for the actor so
that's pretty good money for a day's
work right but guess what it gets better
because actors can also make money off
residuals on those projects let me tell
you what residuals are
basically every time that a production
makes more money in the back end off of
a production
a the actor gets a small percentage of
that so
if uh the production makes more money
off of reruns on a network or
off dvd sales or blu-ray sales or video
on demand or let's say a streaming
picks it up at some point in the future
anytime a production makes more money
off of that project
the actor will make a percentage of that
so that means that you're just going to
get a check in the mail at some point in
the future
whenever that deal is struck so let me
just give you an example
a few years ago i worked on an episode
of a television show i worked one day on
set i made a little over a thousand
dollars that day
but over the next few years my residual
checks came
in and i made probably six or seven
times that
in my residual payments over the course
of the next few years and i'm continuing
to get checks
because that episode continues to get
rerun on the network
so this is why most actors really want
to get into movies and tv shows because
the more work that you get
in these types of projects the more
money that you can make not only on the
days that you work
but also potentially in residuals years
and years down the line
so now you might be thinking wow that
sounds awesome i just want to act in a
ton of movies and television shows
but guess what that's what everybody is
trying to do as well so it's extremely
competitive even the tiny one line rolls
in every movie and show has
thousands of actors trying to get those
roles so it's
really really hard to consistently book
those roles in movies and shows and
that's why
we're talking about the other nine ways
that actors
make money in this industry and the
second way we're going to talk about
is in commercials a lot of actors make a
ton of their income via commercials and
that's because
if a commercial is under a sag after
union contract
you also get residual payments for
commercials as well
and oftentimes those residual payments
can add up to
a lot depending on how much a commercial
is played think about the commercials
that you continuously see
on tv the more a commercial is run the
more those actors on those commercials
are getting paid so
there are actors who make a living by
just doing commercials
because they can be extremely lucrative
and if you can get to
a point where you are the spokesperson
for a brand that's pretty much being a
lead character in a movie or a
television show so that's another
major way that actors make money within
this industry but similar to
film and television there can be a lot
of competition
for commercials as well because of the
potential money that can be made
another way that actors make money in
this industry is by being a stunt
performer now this is a completely
different skill set but
if you are interested and you want to
learn that this can be another way that
opens a lot of doors for you
in this industry because it gives you
more opportunities to get
hired i know people who have worked on
marvel movies and netflix shows as stunt
performers and they make a great living
being able to do that and stunt
performers get residual
checks as well so it can be a great
opportunity to not only work on set but
also make more
money from it now even if your main
career aspirations
is not in stunts it can still be a great
skill to have
because i have seen casting calls where
they are looking for actors who have
stunt experience in their background
so if you are someone who wants to get
physical on set
and thinks that stunt performing might
be something that you'd be
interested in you might want to look
into taking some stunt classes
another way that actors can make money
in the industry is by doing
background work or being an extra now
there are a lot of
strong opinions on whether or not actors
should do background work or how much
they should do
so in my opinion when you're just
getting started and if you have
no credits on your resume you have no
experience whatsoever
doing background work is can be valuable
you can get a lot of on set experience
you can see how a major movie or a
television show
is run and you're getting paid you're
not getting paid as
much as a principal performer but you're
still getting a paycheck
to be on set and to gain some experience
i think in that respect background work
can be very valuable
when you get to the point where you're
starting to book speaking roles then you
might want to start pushing
background work out of your career
here's another thing that you should
think about when you're considering
doing background work if there is a
show that you really want to be on as a
principal performer
you may want to consider not doing
background work for that show
because if your face gets seen as a
background performer then your
character has been established on that
show and you are no longer allowed to
audition for
other roles on that show so this is why
i tell
most people to avoid doing background
work on
shows you can do them on movies or
commercials because they are just
one-off projects and also in commercials
there is a potential that you could get
bumped up to a principal performer it
doesn't happen all the time but it
happens much
more often than on a movie or a
television show
another way that actors make money in
this industry is by being a stand-in now
if you don't know what a stand-in is
it's basically someone
who substitutes for the principal actor
before they start filming while they're
setting up the lights and the camera and
everything like that
you're basically standing in for the
actor while they're trying to get all
the technical details right
now there are a few things i really love
about stand-in work
one you're getting paid more than being
a background actor
two i think the experience that you get
as a stand-in
is even more valuable than the on-set
experience that you would get
as a background actor because now you're
not just in the background you're
literally standing where the main
character or
the principal actor would be on the set
while they're getting the lights and
camera ready
oftentimes they will give you a script
to read as well because they want to get
the whole
blocking down so you really get to feel
what it's like to perform
on camera with the lights and everything
another great benefit is that
your face is never going to be seen as a
stand-in because you
are not a background performer you're
basically taking the place
of the actor before they come out on set
if your face is not seen on camera that
means you can still
audition for that project i know plenty
of actors who have done
stand-in work on a project and also
audition for it and
booked roles on the same project so this
is another great way that you can make
within this industry the next way that
actors can make money within this
industry is by doing theater now
obviously there are a ton of actors who
strictly pursuing theater as their main
profession but even if you're trying to
a career in film and television there
are plenty of opportunities to still do
theater as well now most theater
productions are not going to pay
anywhere near as much as a day on set
of a movie or a television show
especially when you factor in the time
that goes into doing a play but
oftentimes what you're really gaining
from doing a play
is the training from it the the building
of your skills by doing a play on stage
and if you're able to do that and get
paid for it what can be better
the next thing we're going to talk about
is something that i've done a lot of in
my career and that is act
in industrial videos and industrial
video is a video that is created for an
industry rather than for consumption by
the general public so
the main example of an industrial video
is a company training video so if you've
ever worked at a corporation
your first day on the job you probably
watched a training video on how to do
the job
or maybe a safety video on how to be
safe at work
these are examples of industrial videos
that are used all the time
and they hire actors as well so this is
another great way
to put your acting skills to use even
though these types of videos
are not going to be seen by anyone
outside of that particular industry
the next way that actors can make money
within this industry is a really popular
and that is voice acting voice actors
have so many
opportunities basically the same as an
on-camera actor you can do a movie you
can do
television shows right there are
animated movies animated shows you could
be a
voice over actor in commercials voice
over actor in industrial videos
you can do all of the same things that a
on camera actor can do
plus you can do video games you can
do audio books you could do a narrative
podcast now
there are a ton of potential
opportunities available
for people that do voice acting but
remember this is a new skill set so
if you are interested in voice acting
you gotta know how to really control
your voice
specifically for that medium so i highly
recommend you take a voiceover class if
that's something that you want to pursue
here's a way that actors can make money
in this industry that a lot of people
don't think about and that is being a
commercial print model
now i'm not talking about being like a
calvin klein or a victorious secret
model which if you have that look
definitely go for it but there are
modeling jobs available for people that
look like
everyday average human beings i've done
a ton of commercial print modeling in my
life and i'm definitely not that six
foot four runway model type companies
want to hire actors for their print ads
because they want to have someone
who has been trained to express the
emotions that they want to convey in
advertisements so this is another way
that actors can supplement their income
the tenth and final way that we're going
to discuss today about how
actors can make money in the industry is
not really in the industry itself
but it is a way that you can make money
while performing and that is by being a
standardized patient
most medical schools will hire actors to
be standardized patients
to help train their medical students so
your job as a standardized patient
is to improvise a scenario where you
have some health complications
and the medical student's job in this
improvised scenario is to try to
diagnose what your problems are so
instead of getting a script
you're given a set of circumstances and
a scenario for you to act out
and improvise this scene so you're kind
of acting out your shoulder pain or
you're having a headache or whatever
that situation is
and the medical student has to try to
figure out what exactly is
going on so not only are you getting
paid to
act but you're also getting paid to help
train future doctors so
what could feel better than that right
so if you're interested in becoming a
standardized patient
i recommend you just go to google and do
a search for your
your nearest medical school and then
search for standardized patient after
that so for instance
i'm here in atlanta a medical school
that's nearby
is emory medical school so if i just go
to google and search for emory
medical school standardized patient it
takes me right to the website where i
can contact them
and tell them i'm interested in being an
actor for their program

money as an
actor as always if you have any
