what's the best place to live if you
want to pursue an acting career
do you have to live in los angeles or
can you do it from another city
and do you need to move anywhere at all
or can you start your career from
where you live right now also what if
you live
outside of the united states but you
want to pursue a career in american
movies and shows
we're going to talk about all of those
topics in this video
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television industry
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
spending some time here with me today
if this is your first time here hit that
subscribe button to get more videos on
auditioning and career advice every
single week
all right so today's topic is what's the
best place to live to pursue a career in
this particular youtube channel is
focused on
specifically two things acting in the
film and television industry
and acting here in the united states
because that is where
all of my experiences so if you're
interested in pursuing a career in stage
in theater then i'm probably not the
best person to give you advice because i
really don't have experience in that
so i just want to make that clear that
my experience and my advice
only applies to the film and television
here in the united states okay so the
main topic is
what's the best place to live to pursue
an acting career
and i want to separate that question
into two the first
is what's the best place to live to
start your acting career and the second
is what's the best place to live
to grow your acting career because i
think those are two
different questions with two very
different answers so let's tackle the
first one
what's the best place to live to start
your acting career and i think that's an
easy answer and that is
wherever you live right now can you
start an acting career from whatever
city you currently live in
yes 100 yes because the way you
start an acting career is with training
that's the first thing that
everyone needs to do i see too many
people say hey i want to be an actor so
how do i get an audition for a movie or
i want to be an actor how do i get an
agent well those people are getting way
ahead of themselves
i mean think about this imagine if a
teenager said
i really want to play in the nba i've
never played basketball before in my
but i really want to play in the nba so
how can i get a sports agent
that can get me onto a team that sounds
ridiculous doesn't it
they're way ahead of themselves they
need to learn how to play basketball
before they can try to get to play into
the nba
same thing with acting the first step is
not to get an agent the first step is
not to
get a role in a movie immediately the
first step is learning how to act
is by taking acting classes and that can
be done
anywhere in the world no matter what
city that you currently live in
especially now where
so many acting classes are available via
online that means you can sign up for a
class you can
be on camera with an acting coach or an
acting teacher and
perform a scene they can give you
feedback they can give you a critique
and help you
get better those are the steps that you
actually take so
whenever people say that i live in a
small town there are zero
opportunities here that's incorrect
there are opportunities to learn there
are opportunities to get better
and especially if you're brand new
that's the steps that you have to take
anyway so take advantage of those take
advantage of those classes that are
available via zoom
take advantage of all the other things
that you can do while
living wherever you are you can read
acting books
you can check out other resources that
can help you
speaking of resources you can download
my free audition
cheat sheet to help you with your
auditioning all of these things can be
no matter where you live and besides
training what else can you do
in whatever city you currently live in
well you you can actually
gain acting experience you can actually
start to
act and i'm not talking about acting in
big movies and shows let's go back to
that basketball analogy
nobody starts their basketball career by
playing in the nba
there's not a single person who imagine
if they interviewed a basketball player
after an nba game and they said this was
my first time ever playing basketball in
my life
that would be ridiculous wouldn't it so
by the same token
no actor starts their career by being a
lead character in a marvel movie they
work their way up right so in your
current city
even if it's not a big film and
television market
there are probably opportunities to act
and if you're in a small town where
there are not a lot of opportunities
you may live close to a big city if
you're a couple hours away from a major
check out what the opportunities are in
those cities because i'm sure there
are community theater where you can act
in local plays
now look these plays are not going to
have a huge audience
these plays are probably not going to
pay any money but
what you're going to do is you're going
to gain experience you're going to get a
to put onto your resume and you're going
to be getting better as an
actor by doing these things you can also
work on student film so if there's a
college nearby that has a filmmaking
well those students in those filmmaking
programs are going to be making student
films throughout the year
and maybe you can get a part in one of
those student films again
this is not going to provide exposure
this is not going to pay you
any money but you're getting experience
you're getting a credit for your resume
you're also going to get demo reel
and you're it's another opportunity to
act and get better and improve your
there are also opportunities to make
money acting
in pretty much every major city in
most major cities have talent agents now
those talent agents aren't necessarily
the same as the ones in hollywood
they're probably not going to get people
auditions for
star wars movies or whatever but those
in those cities are going to get
auditions for local commercials
for company training videos and
advertisements and things like that
these are the things that i did a ton of
when i was acting in cleveland ohio
cleveland didn't have a bunch of movies
or television shows but i was still
repped by an agent in that city
and i had opportunities to make money
in that market and you might be able to
find those as well
where you live again if you don't live
in a big city look at your nearest big
city and see if there are opportunities
like that available see what agents are
available in those cities
and maybe they can help you jump start
your career
while still living where you are right
now so you can do all of that from your
current city you can start by training
and then you can also start getting some
experience all without moving
anywhere now let's move on to the next
what's the best place to live to grow
your acting career
this is where we start to see some of
the limitations of a small market
and when i say small market i don't
necessarily mean small city
i mean a city or a state where there is
not a lot of film and television
production i mean
a market in terms of just film and tv
production in terms of work available
for actors because
cleveland ohio where i used to live is
not necessarily a small city it's one of
the major cities in the united states
but there just wasn't a lot of film and
television production
in that city or in the state in general
so that's why i consider it
a small market so when you live in a
small market there might be a time where
you reach a plateau
where that market can no longer serve
your career aspirations especially if
you're trying to pursue film and
so while you can start a career from
there may come a time where if you
seriously want to pursue a career in
film and television
where you're going to have to consider
moving to one of the major production
and here in the united states the major
production markets are los angeles
new york city and atlanta those are the
big three there are some other cities
with a lot of production as well like
chicago like new orleans
like albuquerque new mexico and maybe a
handful of others as well
but if you aren't in one of those cities
there's probably going to be a time in
career where
if you really want to grow you're going
to have to move to one of those markets
or at least move
close to within driving distance to one
of those places so now i know a lot of
people will ask well why do i have to
move why can't they cast me
out of wherever i live and then i'll
travel to
whatever city that they're making the
movie or making the show
well the big problem with that two big
problems with that one
is budgetary reasons you got to
understand that
show business is a business making
is a business it costs a lot of money to
make a movie or to make a television
and every movie is a huge risk
it's a millions of dollars of risk
because they have to make that money
back when the movie comes out
so the people that make movies
run it like a business and just like any
other business they're trying
to save money wherever they can and one
way that they can save money is to hire
local actors because when they hire
someone from out of state
or out of town they have to pay their
travel costs they have to pay for a
hotel while they're here
they have to pay their per diem while
they're here so
those are all extra expenses for the
production company when they hire
someone from out of state whereas if
they hire someone who
currently lives in the city they don't
have to pay all of those extra costs so
cheaper for the production so that's why
when there is a show that's filming in
atlanta georgia for example
the actors that live in atlanta or live
near atlanta have the best
opportunity to get auditions for that
show and
thus have the best opportunity to get
in that show now the next thing i know a
lot of people will say is
okay that's fine i'll still live out of
state but i'm willing to work as a local
hire i'm willing to pay my own travel
i'm willing to pay for my own hotel when
i book something
and i'll go to that city and i'll work
on the project and
production hack doesn't have to pay
those extra expenses so they can hire me
well now is where we get into the second
problem and that's a logistical
issue and that is that production
schedules change all the time
and what happens when a production
schedule changes and all of a sudden
instead of needing you here in atlanta
next week
they now need you tomorrow are you able
to get here
at the drop of a hat this is a very
frequent occurrence
in filmmaking it's happened to me before
where i
thought they needed me next week and
then the night before
one day they they said hey we actually
changed our schedule
something came up and we're gonna film
your scene tomorrow instead
well if you live all the way across the
are you able to get a flight and be
that night so that you can be on set
that morning
that's very difficult i know of
instances where that has happened before
where they hired an actor from a
different city
and then when the production schedule
changed that actor couldn't make it
and then production had to scramble and
try to hire a different actor
so that they could stay on schedule so
they want to avoid that at all costs and
one way they can
help make sure that doesn't happen is to
hire local actors
that's why for those two primary reasons
it's really beneficial to live where
the productions are happening my
background is actually a great example
of this when i was living in cleveland
yeah i was trying to get auditions for
movies and television shows
they just weren't coming because i was i
was i lived way too far away
from the production markets on average
in the eight years that i was acting in
ohio i got
one audition for a movie per year on
as soon as i moved to atlanta my first
full year in atlanta
i got over a hundred auditions for
movies and television shows
so that's a hundred times more
that's crazy how much more opportunity
i got as soon as i moved to a major
market production companies aren't doing
this to be mean they're not doing this
they hate people that live in other
cities they're doing this because they
want to save money they're doing this
because it's a good
business decision but remember this
doesn't mean that you should move
immediately it's not like you decide you
want to be an actor and then you should
move right away
do as much as you can in your current
city first get as much training as you
gain as much experience as you can
before making that big move because
a move is a huge financial burden unless
you have
unlimited amounts of money then move
whenever you want
but if you don't then do plan it out
do as much as you can where you are and
then make a plan
to move to a bigger market now if you
are at that point in your career where
you are considering a move what is the
best market to move to
to grow your career is la the only
option is la the best place to go well
a lot of people think so because that's
where hollywood is
this is where i want to make a
distinction between hollywood the city
and hollywood the industry hollywood is
city that is in the la metro area
and yes that's where a lot of production
but hollywood the industry the industry
movies and television shows that we call
happens all over the country there are
many different cities like i mentioned
new york
atlanta new mexico louisiana and a bunch
of others chicago
i currently live in atlanta as many of
you know who follow my channel
i've never actually lived in los angeles
i've never lived in hollywood
and yet i've been able to work on a
bunch of big movies and big television
that most people will consider hollywood
hollywood shows right so you can live in
other markets
but you have to know which ones have the
most production
in my opinion when you weigh all the
pros and cons
i think atlanta is the best market
for actors who want to grow their
careers in
film and television i've actually made a
completely separate video
all about acting in atlanta i'll put a
link to it down in the description below
so if you want to hear some of my
reasons why i think atlanta is the best
go check out that video but maybe
atlanta isn't right for you
again it was right for me and i know
it's been really great for a lot of my
actor friends that live here
but uh it's a personal decision you may
there might be reasons why chicago may
be a better option or even
la might be a better option for instance
what if you already live in california
but you and you don't want to live too
far from home then maybe la is a better
option for you and you don't want to go
all the way across the country to
atlanta right so like i said this is a
personal decision
it's a big decision so do your research
research all the big markets see what
the pros and cons are
before you make a final decision of
where to move okay now let me talk to
the international actors out there the
people that live in another country but
want to pursue an acting career here in
the united states
listen i really wish that i could tell
you that it was going to be easy
i really wish that i could tell you you
could just follow these three simple
and then you can get an agent you can
start auditioning for movies and
television shows
but the reality is that it's going to be
very very difficult to do from another
remember the story that i told you about
my experience
when i lived in ohio i had a really hard
time getting an agent
to represent me for film and television
they considered me too far away from
where the film and television production
and i was already living in america i
was already living
in the united states but i was in the
wrong city i was too far away from where
the productions were going on
so imagine how much harder it would be
for someone that lived in another
right you got to think about this
think about acting just like any other
job if you
put it in perspective of other jobs if i
wanted to
have a job as a doctor in a german
can i do that from the u.s no i would
have to move to germany to do that
if i wanted to be a chef in a japanese
i can't do it from where i live i would
have to move to japan to really pursue
so similarly if you want your job to be
an actor in american movies and tv shows
then you really will have to move to the
to make that happen and i say that fully
understanding that
that is not an option for a lot of
people either for family reasons or
financial reasons that it's
really hard to make that move to the us
the only time that i've seen it happen
where someone that lived in another
was able to get an agent in the u.s was
when that person who lived in another
already had experience acting in movies
and television shows in their home
meaning they were already a working
actor in their own country
that's the only time i've seen someone
that lived
overseas get an agent in the united
i have not seen a single situation where
someone lived in another country and
they were brand new
had no experience acting in movies and
shows and was able to get an
agent in the us maybe there is someone
out there who
has made that happen and if you know
someone who has made that happen
tell me who they are let me know down in
the comments put me in touch with them i
would love to
interview them on my channel so that i
could spread the word and tell people
how they were able to make that happen
but in my experience in my 12 years as
an actor and from all the other actors
that i know
i've yet to meet someone like that so
the best advice that i can give
you is that if you are 100 determined
to be an actor in american movies and
television shows
then while you are in your current
country do as much as you can in terms
of training
in terms of gaining as much experience
as you can
and while you're doing that make a plan
someday move to the united states no
what it takes it might take you years i
don't know i don't really know much
about immigration so you'll have to
research that on your own but i do know
that there are actors that move to the
all the time because that's what they
want to do they want to pursue
a career here in the united states and
they've made the move here
so if that's what you want for your
you might want to consider making a plan
to move to america
