what's the truth about monologues well
i'm going to tell you my opinion about
them in this video
and it might be a little controversial
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television industry
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
spending some time here with me today if
this is your first time here
make sure to subscribe to this channel
to get more videos on acting auditioning
and career advice every single week
and who knows maybe this is going to be
the week where you unsubscribe from my
channel because
you disagree with what i have to say
today in fact
if you do disagree let me know down in
the comments below
why and tell me why i am wrong i know
this is going to be
a little bit controversial but first
actually let me say that let me
acknowledge that my
thumbnail that i used for this video is
a little bit click-baity
in the thumbnail i wrote that monologues
suck and i don't really believe that
monologues suck
per se but i do think they are overrated
i do think there are a lot of people
that put way too much emphasis on
monologues when i think they should be
spending their time learning
other things in the acting career now
let me say that i am not a theater actor
and i've never really been a theater
actor and i understand that in the
theater world
monologues are used quite a bit but i
come from the on-camera world
pretty much my entire career has been
spent doing on-camera acting
starting out doing commercials and
industrials and then moving into movies
and television shows
so i've been a working actor for almost
13 years now
and in my entire 13-year career i have
never been asked to perform a monologue
outside of class let me say that again
i have never once in my entire 13-year
been asked to perform a monologue
outside of the classroom never from an
never from a casting director never from
a producer or a director or writer or
anybody else in this industry
so that's why i think monologues are a
little overrated
now i want to emphasize again that if
you are pursuing
theater either alone or in conjunction
a film career then i understand that
you're going to have to learn monologues
for the theater side of your career
but if you are someone like me who is
pretty much only pursuing the film and
television side of an acting career
then i just don't know how useful
learning a bunch of monologues is
now i'm not saying to
not work on your acting i'm just saying
that i think you should focus your work
off of monologues and onto other aspects
of acting
particularly working on scenes i think
it's much more beneficial for someone
who is pursuing an on-camera acting
to work on scene work rather than
scenes meaning a scene that is a
between two people so that you can
showcase both your acting while you are
as well as you're acting while you're
listening and responding
in my opinion when you perform a scene
with dialogue
it showcases more of your acting
abilities anyway
than performing a monologue look it just
it doesn't make any sense to me to learn
a bunch of monologues when um when i
end up getting a real audition and they
never asked me
to do that monologue 100 of the time
for a film and television audition
you're going to be asked to perform a
with dialogue they will never ask you to
do a monologue
and yeah sometimes you'll be auditioning
for a character like a tv news anchor
or a politician who performs a speech
and in those cases that character is
speaking by themselves and there is no
but in in my experience that's like
less than one percent of my auditions
look i've been tracking my auditions
since the very beginning and i've had
over 900
close to a thousand auditions now
throughout my career
and in those over 900 auditions
never once have they asked me to do a
whether it's been an audition for a
commercial or an industrial
or a movie or a short film or a student
or a big budget feature film nobody's
ever asked me to do a monologue who
knows maybe
audition number 1000 is gonna be it
maybe that's when they'll finally ask me
to perform one of my monologues
but i'm not holding my breath and here's
my other issue with
monologues even in the classroom look i
have no problem with monologues being
taught in the classroom but i still feel
like they are emphasized
a bit too much and especially too early
in my opinion i don't think brand new
should be working on monologues because
i think it makes them
self-conscious and self-centered i think
that new actors need to learn that
acting is not an
individual activity that acting is
collaborative that acting is
teamwork that's why i loved studying the
meisner technique because from day one
the very first exercise in the meisner
technique repetition
taught actors to take the attention off
of themselves
and put it on their scene partner to
stop thinking about yourself
and pay attention to the other person in
the scene
look taking the attention off of
yourself and putting all of your focus
on your scene partner so that you can
truthfully listen and respond that's the
foundation of acting
and it's just so much easier in my
to teach that working with a scene
and it's just so much harder to to learn
it by doing monologues
all good scripts and screenplays explore
conflict and relationships and
objectives and obstacles right
and i just feel like it's so much easier
actors to learn those concepts through
doing scene work
through working with a scene partner and
having dialogue and
interacting with another human being
it's so much harder in my opinion to
learn those things
with a monologue it can be applied to
monologues for sure
but that's why i think learning
monologues should come later in an
actor's education i think
learning uh how to work with a scene
partner should
come earlier master how to work with
a scene partner and then learn how to do
a monologue because
look when you do a monologue you have to
imagine the person that you're talking
i mean why put that burden on a brand
new actor to force them to imagine a
human being rather than to
actually put them in a scene with a
human being and learn that first
and i know there are going to be a lot
of people out there who are watching
this video saying
well i don't know any other actors how
do i work on a scene when
when i don't know anybody else who's an
actor and
look i feel like i say this in almost
all of my videos i talk about the
importance of acting class but this is
another reason
getting into an acting class so that you
meet other actors so that you can work
on scenes together that's such an
important part
so that you can learn that acting is not
an individual activity that is
the truth is if you're just staying at
home and working on monologues by
yourself that's not going to teach you
how to act
it just isn't and and i understand if
some of you
don't have the money to get into acting
class right now totally understandable
but find a way to work with another
human being
see if you can find someone else who is
also interested in acting
who may want to work with you and learn
with you either work with them in person
or work with them on a zoom call or
something like that but
get in front of someone face to face so
you can work on a scene together and i
promise you working on a scene together
with another actor
is going to improve your acting much
more than working on a monologue by
especially when you are brand new hey
let me know what you think about this
i know some of you that watch my videos
are working actors just like me
so if you have had a totally different
experience than me
if you've been asked to perform
monologues a lot in your career
then let me know down in the comments
i'd love to hear that okay
um all right so that's it for this video
if you liked it please give it a thumbs
if you didn't like it and you totally
disagree with me give me a thumbs down
but don't just give me a thumbs down
tell me wrong tell me why tell me the
reason down below
okay until next time keep practicing
keep learning and i hope to see you on
set one day
