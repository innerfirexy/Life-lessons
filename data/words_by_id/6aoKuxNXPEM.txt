hey guys what's up in this video i'm
going over the top seven
tax write-offs or strategies that
self-employed people can utilize
as a self-employed person myself i've
taken many many write-offs and used many
different strategies
saving me a ton of money in the process
if you want to reduce your taxable
income legally then make sure to
implement these things right now
all i want to do is help you guys save
as much money as possible so let's get
started first one
is creating an s corp a lot of people
think that llcs
help with taxes but that's not the truth
simply having an llc means you're still
taxed as a sole proprietorship however
you can have an llc with an escort
or you can just go directly into making
an escort now when you're doing work as
a sole proprietor
15.3 percent of your income is going
straight to the government as
self-employment tax aka fica this is
made up of medicare as well as social
and you'll be paying this 15.3 percent
on all income up to 137
000 after that it drops down to 2.9
percent and there are some more little
increases for
high high income earners now the beauty
of s corpse is that they allow you to
reduce how much income
you're paying this fica on let's say you
make 130
dollars in the last year with your
business and you have thirty thousand
dollars of expenses this means that your
net income is a hundred thousand dollars
now if you run that through your sole
proprietorship you're gonna be paying
about fifteen percent
on that so fifteen thousand dollars
that's in addition to
federal income tax as well as state
income tax so the cool thing about an s
corp is that you're actually
treated as an employee of your own s
corp so you choose to pay yourself
reasonable salary and the rest of it
gets paid out to you through a
distribution you need to pay yourself a
reasonable salary so let's say out of
that hundred thousand dollar profit
you set a salary of forty thousand
dollars for yourself this means that
you're paying that fifteen point three
percent fica on that forty thousand
w-2 salary but the rest of the money
that sixty thousand dollars is going to
be paid to you as a pass through
distribution this means you skip out on
that fifteen point three percent tax
completely in this case fifteen point
three percent of sixty thousand dollars
is around nine thousand dollars so
that's how much you'd be saving by
treating your business
as an s corp for tax purposes anytime
someone is making over 50 thousand
dollars in profit through their business
i tell them to start looking at
potentially creating an s corp you'll
save a lot of money in the long run
and this is completely legal the second
really big tax strategy or deduction
is running off your car what you want to
do is you want to ask yourself
do you drive a lot for business you'll
likely have a personal car
but if you can actually use that car
sometimes for business purposes then
that can definitely be a write-off there
are two different ways to take
vehicle deduction there's the mileage
method and there's the actual expenses
now for this year for the mileage method
you can write off 57.5 cents
per business mile driven so let's say in
one year you drive 10
000 business miles using your car this
means that you can write off 5
750 on your taxes the other method is
using the actual expenses method and
this will allow you to write off your
lease payments
interest payments on your car loan gas
maintenance tires insurance and all
these different things
you basically add all those payments up
and multiply it by the percentage
business use you can even do a section
179 using bonus depreciation
what this does is it allows you to write
off the whole car
in one year if it's over 6 000 pounds
and it's used for business
if you drive a lot of miles but you have
a cheaper car then it's probably better
to use the mileage method if you drive
less miles but have a more expensive car
then using the actual expenses method is
probably going to be a little bit better
i definitely recommend talking to your
cpa or tax strategist about this
because you can save a lot of money the
third thing that you guys can do is
actually just hire your kids this is a
very underused method but you can
actually really minimize your tax
here's how it works you're basically
going to pay your children
up to the standard deduction each year
when you're doing this they're not
paying any taxes
and you don't have to pay any payroll
taxes either this works if they are your
own children and they're under 18 years
old now you can't just pay them for not
doing anything
they have to be doing a real service for
your company
for example let's say you have a youtube
business right you could hire them to
help you edit videos or do research this
is also really great because it teaches
them to do work
and what i recommend doing is paying
them out of your sole proprietorship
business so you can get those right off
from your own
income taxes don't pay them directly
from your s corp if your kid is over 18
years old and they're an adult
then you'll just issue them a 10.99 or a
w-2 they still won't pay taxes or even
if they do their tax rate is going to be
a lot lower than yours probably and if
your kids already in college
don't pay for it directly rather you
want to pay them and then have them pay
the tuition
fourth tax strategy is to definitely
definitely have
a retirement plan there are so many
different benefits of investing in a
retirement plan
and the most obvious is that you're only
paying tax one time
compare that to a normal brokerage
account where you're paying taxes on the
money you're putting in and you're
paying taxes on any profit that you make
for most of you guys i think the solo
is going to be the best route to take
but you can also do a sep if you want so
for me i do have a solo 401k
and i'm able to open up one of these
because i don't have any full-time w-2
i do have independent contractors that i
pay on a 1099 but that still makes you
eligible for a solo 401k now when you're
choosing to do a solo 401k
you can choose to do a roth or a
traditional 401k i won't get into too
many of the details but with a roth
you're paying taxes upfront and with the
traditional you're paying taxes later on
if you have an s corp which i definitely
recommend most people do you'll have a
19.5 000
employee contribution this is the
baseline that almost everyone is going
to be able to put in
and you'll have an additional 25
employer contribution so let's say again
you have an s corp and you have a
hundred thousand dollars of profit
you're taking a 40 000
salary so you can put in up to 19.5 000
as an employee since you're also the
employer you can put in 25
of your salary so that's 10 000 and if
you add these two things up you're gonna
get 29.5 000
that you can put into your solo 401k
this is a really great way to build your
net worth
and i definitely recommend taking
advantage of these retirement plans the
next thing you guys should definitely do
is have a home
office deduction most self-employed
people are going to work from home and
you should probably have a home office
for it to count as a write-off you have
to use the house exclusively for
conducting business
so let's say this could be part of your
bedroom with a desk or it could be a
separate home office room it also needs
to be the principal place of business
how it works is you can basically deduct
a percentage of your housing costs or
rent what you'll do is you'll find the
square footage of your home office
and then divide that by the total square
feet you're left with a percentage and
you can take that percentage of your
mortgage your rent your utilities
all the stuff you can write this off in
your personal tax return or i've heard
this is even better
is to write it off in your s corp tax
return and you do this as
a rental expense yes this could increase
your risk for an audit but just
make sure you do it right you are
absolutely 100
entitled to take this right off a lot of
people are scared but you definitely
should not
be scared as long as you do it right
number six on the list is
any education expenses if you're an
entrepreneur then you probably spend a
good amount of
money and time on your self-improvement
and education
for example if you guys were to buy my
youtube course then you could totally
write that off or if you're going to buy
books if you're going to attend seminars
or trainings all these things can be tax
if it contributes to your business in
any way then you can absolutely write
this off and this brings me into my next
point which is
expenses you guys should be expensing
anything that is related to your
and with equipment the cool thing is
that you can write off the whole thing
in just one year for example a computer
a desk
cameras chairs all these things you can
write off you can even write off your
dining expenses
and there are lots of details that i
won't go over in this video but to make
it simple
you can write off 50 of your costs of
dining out
this is both when you're talking about
business with someone else or even if
you're just eating by yourself and
you're traveling when you travel you
want to spend
four hours per day or more on business
and when you do that you can write off
the whole entire trip
i'm talking your hotel your airfare your
uber rental car
all these different things that a lot of
people don't write off if you can
turn your trips into business trips go
look at real estate
go attend a conference visit a client or
maybe even film a vlog
now definitely for some industries this
is easier for example
youtube i can literally go on a trip and
start making content there
and that would definitely make it a
business expense don't be afraid to be
aggressive with your tax write-offs if
you can
argue that it's for business or it's
helping you make money
then write it off okay in conclusion you
guys taxes are very complicated
the tax code is complicated but the
interpretation of the tax code
is even more complicated as a business
owner you are entitled to
take a lot of write-offs that you
probably aren't taking right now and
there are so many different tax
strategies that you should use as well
using all these different tricks will
heavily decrease the amount of money
you're paying in taxes and you already
know this but
taxes are probably your biggest business
when you can reinvest the money you're
saving on taxes into your business then
that's good for both you as well as the
government because it means that you are
stimulating the economy
