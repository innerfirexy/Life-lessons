during my first year of business at a
wedding photography consultation
i was sitting with a bride and groom
across from me and the bride
asked me how old i was at the time i was
only 18 years old because i started my
business when i was 17 years old
and she mumbled over to the groom and
said see
told you she was young at one time or
another chances are
someone has told us something similar
they told us we're too young too old too
not enough or um any other thing
that makes us doubt ourselves or if
someone hasn't told us that we've
probably told ourselves that
right we've probably thought oh like i'm
too young to be doing this
i'm too old to be doing this i'm not
qualified to be doing this
i think at one point or another all of
us go through seasons
of doubts we go through seasons of
imposter syndrome
seasons where we feel like we are not
qualified to be doing what we're doing
because of some reason that is
completely false
and i really just want to encourage you
today that if you have ever thought any
of those things
even if you're just starting out if you
are years in
that one they're not true they're
false they are myths that you are
and that you're letting affect the way
that you show up in the world
backtrack again to that story i just
told you about that client
if i had let that client stop me from
pursuing my business
at that point i hadn't photographed any
weddings on my own yet i was second
shooting with other photographers
i did not even start this online
education business i have now
if i had let that stop me i wouldn't
have photographed
over a hundred weddings in the past five
years a hundred
if i had let that stop me i wouldn't
have helped over 900
online students over the past year
that's insane
there's so many people literally
hundreds and hundreds of people
that i have impacted through my
photography through my online education
and if i had let her doubts stop me if i
had let my own doubts and insecurities
stop me
i would not be where i am today so you
have to make sure
that your confidence doesn't come from
what others think about you or even what
you think about you
and that it comes from something else
right for me my faith is really
important to me
and that's where my foundation is that's
why i
don't waver or i shouldn't waver right
when someone doubts me or even when i
doubt myself because i know my
confidence comes from somewhere else
it comes from something that's
unshakable it comes from something that
tells me that i
am worthy that i have a special talents
and abilities
that nobody else has and the way that i
show up in the world is going to impact
people in a way that's different
from everybody else because of my unique
abilities because of my unique talents
because of my unique strengths and
because of the way that i was created
the way i was created so differently
from every other single person
on this planet so if you're having
self-doubts if you're having
trouble having the confidence to pursue
your business or to push forward in your
business or maybe you're having doubts
from others in your life don't let that
stop you
seriously you have unique gifts
that you can bring to the table that i
can't bring to the table
you're going to impact and serve certain
people in ways that i never could
and those people who doubt you it's okay
if not everyone gets it
it's okay if not everyone understands
why you're doing this thing or why
you're showing up but
push forward anyway have confidence in
knowing that you were created with
purpose you were created in a unique way
that is going to impact so many people
and if you let imposter syndrome stop
if you let those doubts and insecurities
stop that
you're going to hold yourself back from
impacting all of these people that you
could in your business
so if it's something that you feel
called to if it's something that you
want to pursue
chase your dreams of doing it just go
for it i promise you it is so
worth it no matter if you want to pursue
pursue a photography business no matter
if you want to pursue
being a youtuber or whatever it is i
know it can be scary
it can be crazy scary to do something
new and put yourself out there a little
but i promise it's completely worth it
it is a roller coaster
but it's completely worth it and i
wouldn't have it any other way and so if
you're a photographer
