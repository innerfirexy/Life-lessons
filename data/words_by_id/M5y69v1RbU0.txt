- Hey friends welcome back to the channel
In this video we're gonna talk about
nine different ways that you can make passive income
And for each of those I'm gonna talk
about how hard it is to get started
how hard it is to make $100 a month from it
and how hard it is to maintain
once you've created the thing in the first place
For me in my business these nine different sources
generate around $27,000 per week
these days with varying degrees of passiveness
And obviously this has taken me
like eight years to build up
So don't expect to be hitting those sorts
of numbers when you first get started
But this is the video that I wish I would have had
when I started my financial independence journey
many many years ago let's go for it
All right so when I say passive income
I always air quote it
because there is really no such thing as passive income
There is no way to make money without doing anything at all
But when I say passive income
what I mean is that its money
that is not directly tied to our time
So let's say you were to write a book
If you write a book you publish a book
that book is now on bookshelves
You've done the work kind of once
to write and publish the book
But now anytime the book sells
you make money from royalties that is passive income
You could literally be making money while you sleep
because you've created this thing
which is out in the world
which is generating income for you
The other thing with passive income is
that it always takes a very long time to get going
So if you see any ads before this video
talking about how you can get rich quick by whatever scheme
or if you see people in the comments
pretending to be me (screenshot pops)
saying "Oh my God here's how you can get rich quick
with crypto WhatsApp this number."
That is all a scam it's not gonna work
There is no way to get rich quick
It is not a thing
So if you're looking for a get rich quick scheme
those things just don't exist
So you might as well not even try
And the way I think of this
is that ultimately money is just a medium
for exchanging value
The only way to make money is to provide value
And the only way to make passive income passive money
is to provide value in a way
that is not directly tied to your time
So please please please do not try
and join and get-rich-quick scheme they don't exist
I've had lots of messages over the years
from people who have tried signing up
to a get-rich-quick crypto scheme or a gambling scheme
or a "Hey here's how you kind of play poker online."
None of these things ever work
People always end up losing money
The only way to make money is by providing value
And so let's talk about
the nine different ways (icons pop)
that you could provide value if you wanted to
Just before we dive in I wanna tell you
that I've just launched my brand new Skillshare class
about Productivity for Creators
how to start a successful side hustle
That's linked in the video description
Skillshare is sponsoring this video
I will tell you more about Skillshare later on
but I wanna plug my own class
because I think it's genuinely really good
and people really like it and it'll help you get tips
on how you can start side hustles in your spare time
Anyway let's get into the video
All right so let's kick things off
with investing in stocks and shares
And in this context the way that we provide value
is by offering up our money
Providing money and investing in a service
is in a way giving a form of value
And so when we give our money to a company
in the form of buying their stocks
it makes sense that we would get some kind of return
for that investment
And we're starting with this
because investing in stocks is the easiest way
to make any kind of passive income
If you have any sorts of savings
and they're sitting in a savings account
earning 0.01% interest
they're not really doing very much for you
Whereas if you had those stay savings and put them
in stocks you could potentially be earning passive income
from the money that's otherwise just sitting there
Now I've got a whole video
called "The Ultimate Guide to Investing
in Stocks and Shares for Beginners"
which is gonna be linked over there somewhere
So that is a solid half hour-long introduction
to stocks and exactly how they work
But the thing that I recommend
for most beginners as a non-financial advisor
and this is not financial advice
purely for entertainment purposes only
or so people say or at least the thing that I do
is that basically all my money
that's in stocks and shares is invested in index funds
Now an index fund is something like the S&amp;P 500
And when you invest let's say $1,000 in the S&amp;P 500
that basically means that your $1,000 is distributed
amongst the top 500 biggest companies in the US
So weighted by how big they are
So like 2% of it would be an Apple
2% in Facebook 2% in Google 2% in Microsoft
And then you probably won't have heard
of the 500th company on the list
but basically all the big US companies you've heard of
you end up investing in all of them a little bit at a time
So if you wanna get started with that
all you need to do is sign up to a stockbroker
If you're in the US you can use a Webull
I think I've got a link in the description
If you're in the UK you can use Freetrade or Vanguard
Basically whatever country you're in
just Google the phrase best stock broker platform
your country name
and you'll find something that works for you
And then it's very easy to be able
to invest in an index fund
So within our famous side hustle assessment matrix
we're gonna give the difficulty of starting
a one-star rating one out of five
It's very very easy to get started with stocks
How hard is it to make $100 a month
by investing in stocks and shares
Well this kind of depends because it depends
on the performance of the stock market overall
So in the last 12 months from 2020 to 2021
the S&amp;P 500 has actually increased by about 50%
That is a lot it's like gone up
by a solid 50% despite COVID and everything going on
So if in April 2020
you had invested $2,400 in the S&amp;P 500
the fact that it's gone up by 50%
means you would've made $100 a month
But obviously this is not the way to look at it
because things can go up and down
and the stock market has different levels
of performance depending on
what time period you're looking at
But if we average out the last 30 to 50 years
the S&amp;P 500 has had
a roughly 10 point something percent return
Which means every year on average over the longterm
it goes up by around 10%
This is not inflation-adjusted for any economists among us
And so if we do some back of the envelope calculations
if we wanna earn $100 a month passively
through stocks and shares we would need
around about $12,000 invested in the S&amp;P 500
to make that 10% $1,200 a year which is $100 a month
But as I talk about in that video about stocks
overtime we have compounding
and so if you put in $7,500 in the S&amp;P 500
and you left it there for five years
then five years later
you would be making roughly $100 a month
if we go by this very average figure of 10% a year
Or if you invested $5,000 in the S&amp;P 500
then 10 years later you'd be making $100 a month
in purely passive income
Again assuming the 10% average
So overall how hard is it really
to make $100 a month in passive income
from stocks and shares
Well it kinda just depends on how hard is it
for you to make 5,000 7,500 or $12,000 in savings
and put them into a stock market index fund
And crucially this is money that you shouldn't need to touch
in the next five to 10 years at least
So basically how easy is it for you to make
that sort of money
Obviously varies massively
depending on which country you're in (laughs)
and what your circumstances are and what your job is
But if you're in the UK or the US
where the median kind of average salary's
roundabout $50,000 something like that
then again depending on your circumstances
it's not that hard to get $10,000 in savings
Obviously if you're supporting a family
of 15 people on $50,000 it's different
If you're a single person again it's different
but I'm gonna give this roughly
a three out of five-star rating for difficulty
of getting $100 a month
Obviously if you live in a country like India
where the average salary is $3,600 a year
it's very very difficult to make $10,000 in savings overall
And finally the third category
in our side hustle assessment matrix
is how hard is it to maintain this income
once you've set it up in the first place
And we're gonna give this a one star out of five
because once you've got the money in you just like set it
and forget it and it's not that hard to maintain
There are other sources of passive income
that require higher degrees of maintenance over time
But stocks and shares is a very very easy way
to make passive income and to use my personal example
these days my stocks and shares portfolio
which I've been investing in since 2015
is now worth a roundabout of $350,000
And the vast majority of that is in the S&amp;P 500 index fund
Now I can't be bothered
to work out the actual inflation-adjusted returns for that
But again if we assume a very very rough average
of 10% a year then that averages out
to around $682 per week in purely passive income
All right idea number two for generating passive income
is to start a YouTube channel
This is something I well specialize in
because I'm here on YouTube and I actually teach a course
called the Part-Time YouTuber Academy
linked in the video description
where I teach people how to do this sort of thing
So let's use a side hustle assessment matrix
and we'll talk about this
How hard is it to start a YouTube channel
Well I'm gonna give this one out of five stars
because it's actually very very easy
to start a YouTube channel
You just go on youtube.com
You click to create a channel and you can upload videos
by just filming with your phone and uploading it
In reality it's a lot harder to make good videos
and making good videos is how you grow on YouTube
But getting started on YouTube
is very very very straightforward
The real question is how hard is it to actually
make real money from YouTube
So again let's say we wanna make $100 a month
in passive income
What does that look like
Well firstly to be eligible for monetization
on YouTube you need a thousand subscribers
and 4,000 hours of watch time
It took me six months and 52 videos
to get my first 1,000 subscribers
And if we look at the averages
it actually takes on average 90 something videos
to get to 1,000 subscribers
So that's quite hard if you're thinking
you're gonna start a YouTube channel
and start making money from day one
your you know that's basically not going to happen
It took me 52 videos six months to get there
So if people message me being like
"Hey I wanna start a YouTube..."
I was like "Look you have to be able to put in the effort
and do this for a very long period of time
at least once a week."
I say for at least two years
before you can expect anything in return
But let's say you've hit your thousand subscribers
and your 4,000 hours of watch time
How hard is it to actually make $100 a month
Well on average the kind of revenue per thousand views
on YouTube is roundabout $2
So this varies massively but let's say on average
about $2 per thousand views
Therefore if you want to make $100 a month
you need 50,000 views on YouTube to make $100 a month
Let's say you make one video per week
and let's assume you're not getting any traffic
on your older videos
That means every video you make needs to get
around about 12,500 views
And very roughly the average YouTube channel
can expect a roundabout 20% of their subscribers
to equal the average view count for each video
So on YouTube if you had 62,000 subscribers
very roughly very average lead
you can expect 20% of them i.e 12,500 views on each video
And assuming you have no evergreen content of the longterm
you would need to run about 60,000 subscribers
to be making $100 a month
In reality you make $100 a month a lot
before 60,000 subscribers
I think I was making $100 a month
when I had like 10,000 something subscribers
like it was fairly early on
But when it comes to assessing how hard is this to do
I'm gonna give this a four out of five stars
It's actually very hard to make compelling YouTube videos
and it's very easy to get started but it's hard to do well
It's totally worth it it's a great skill set
it's really fun
You get to meet people across the internet
You get to learn how to talk to a camera
and how to film and video edit
And it's really great but it's very hard
to actually make money from YouTube
Finally in terms of effort to maintain
Like actually getting that first thousand subscribers
is a lot harder than keeping it growing
'Cause once you've got a thousand subscribers
and once your channel is growing
it means you've landed on a formula that works
And so maintaining it then becomes easier
then starting from scratch
And so in our side hustle assessment matrix
we're gonna give maintenance
of a YouTube channel passive income stream
to be round about two out of five stars
To use my example I made 70 videos
before I started making any money from YouTube AdSense
And these days the YouTube channel
makes a roundabout $12,000 a month
in passive income from YouTube AdSense
Now again this is not entirely passive
because I keep on uploading new videos
but actually the bulk of the amount of money
that we generate from ads is from older videos
rather than videos that were uploaded this month
So with that caveat $12,000 a month passive income
is roundabout $3,000 a week
thanks to this YouTube channel
and thanks to you guys for supporting it and all that stuff
There are other ways of monetizing YouTube
like brand deals and like selling merch
and just all other sorts of stuff
But it doesn't really count as passive income
through YouTube which is why I'm not including this
in this side hustle assessment matrix
Idea number three for making passive income
is to start a podcast
This is generally easier than starting a YouTube channel
Although growing a podcast is a lot harder
then growing a YouTube channel
because podcasts themselves don't really have an algorithm
that's helping them grow
In fact a lot of podcasts grow by having a YouTube channel
which is kind of weird
Right so how hard is it to start a podcast
Well again one out of five stars
it's very very easy to start a podcast
Go on anchor.fm and you can literally use your phone
and you could pass your phone around
between you and your friends and you can start a podcast
You can use a website called riverside.fm
that I've recently invested in as an angel investor
Riverside makes it very easy
to record remote podcast interviews
It's very very easy to start a podcast
but how hard is it to make $100 a month
in passive income from a podcast
Well again this is not quite passive income
because the way podcasters make money
is by relying on brand deals
There is no YouTube AdSense for podcasts
And so you need sponsorship or a brand deal
to make any money for your podcast generally speaking
And apparently you can expect to make
around $18 for a 30-second ad in a podcast
and $25 per thousand views or a thousand listens
for a 60 second ad
So if you wanna make $100 a month
and assuming you have a stream of sponsorships
who are giving you that level of a sponsorship deal
based on your download numbers
you would need around 1,000 downloads per episode
if you have a weekly podcast
So you'd have 4,000 downloads a month
And if you're putting a 60-second ad in there
for $25 per thousand views
that would make you round about $100 a month
By having a thousand downloads per episode
and four episodes per month
This begs the question how hard is it
to get a thousand downloads per month
Well it's a lot harder
to get a thousand podcast downloads per month
than it is to get a thousand YouTube views per month
Because again YouTube has so much distribution built in
it's different to podcasts
Also loads more people are on YouTube than on podcasts
But if we look at the stats then it's the top 20%
of podcasts in the world that get on average
more than a thousand downloads per episode
To use a friend of mine as an example
my housemate Sheen started her own podcast
around five months ago there'll be a link to that
in the description if you want to check it out
and on average her podcast gets roundabout
400 to 500 downloads per episode
This is not bad at all specially considering
she started five months ago
and had zero audience when she started
So she didn't have the unfair advantage
that I did when starting my own podcast for example
And because she's just launched season two of her podcasts
and has just started posting videos about it on YouTube
that will really help the podcast grow
And I'm pretty sure that in the next six months
she'll be getting to a point where she can quite easily
make $100 a month from her podcast
So going back to our side hustle assessment matrix
Starting a podcast one out of five stars
making $100 a month I'm gonna give that
a three out of five stars because it's hard
but not as hard as maybe monetizing on YouTube
where you have this minimum threshold
And finally maintenance
Well it's not really passive income
because you do have to keep on making podcast episodes
because the brand deals are associated with that
But again once you've stumbled on a formula that works
once you know how to be a podcaster it's easier
to continue going once you've already gotten started
as is the case with most things
And so in terms of maintenance of the podcast
I'm gonna give that two stars
To use me as an example so me and my brother have a podcast
called Not Overthinking link in the video description
if you wanna check it out
but we make around about $625 per week
from the podcast overall from brand deals
and from our membership
All right so idea number four for generating passive income
is to become an affiliate marketer
Affiliate marketing means
that you are selling other people's products
but you're getting a percentage of the sales
from those products
Now apparently 48% of affiliate marketers globally
earn $20,000 a year which is $1,660 a month
Which is actually not bad at all
Like people are doing very well
with affiliate marketing overall
So how hard is it to get started with affiliate marketing
Well I'm gonna give this a two out of five stars
Basically you can just sign up to an affiliate program
like Amazon Associates
So Amazon have their own affiliate program
which I think is probably the biggest in the world
And then once you have your little special links
you can post those on your website
or on Twitter or on social media or whatever
And if people buy the product through your link
or in fact buy any product on Amazon through your link
you'll get like some tiny percentage of the sales
So pretty easy to get started with affiliate marketing
but how hard is it to make $100 a month
Well this is actually kinda hard
So let's say you had a product that was $50
that you were trying to sell
and you were getting 5% commission on it
That'd be pretty good
Amazon doesn't offer nearly as much
as 5% it offers like two or 3% something like that
And let's say your average conversion rate
i.e people visiting the thing versus people actually
buying the product after visiting the thing
let's say that's 1% which is pretty reasonable
for conversion rate
You would need 8,000 visits to your website
or whatever to make $100 a month
It's actually quite hard to get 8,000 visits per month
to your website to a specific product page
And generally doing well in affiliate marketing
requires lots of upfront effort in terms
of either building an audience
or building such domain authority
in whatever space you're in
that you're sort of organically getting traffic
Now other than Amazon there are a few other
affiliate programs that I'm part of
One of them is Skillshare
who are kindly sponsoring this video
I'll tell you about the sponsor segment later
but Skillshare has an interesting affiliate program
where if you refer someone to sign up
to a free trial of Skillshare
you can get $7 in affiliate commission just for that thing
So if you wanted to make $100 a month from affiliates
you would need 15 people every month to sign up
for Skillshare with your affiliate link thing
How hard is it to get 15 people a month
to sign up with your affiliate link
Well it's not that hard if you have an audience
and it's not that hard if you have your own classes
on Skillshare like I do I have like nine of them
And so if I wanna make money through Skillshare affiliates
I can just tell people "Hey guys,"
like I can tell you that "Guys I've just released
my latest Skillshare class Productivity for Creators
how to start a successful side hustle
so there'll be a link in the video description
if you wanna check that out."
Like that would be hopefully some of you will see that
will click on that link in the description
and then that will be me getting some affiliate income
from Skillshare for this video
So going back to our side hustle assessment matrix
how hard is it to make $100 a month
I'm gonna give this a 3.5-star rating
because again you need an audience
And as we always talk about on this channel
the way you build an audience is by creating useful content
putting it for free on the internet once a week
and doing this for at least two years
If you just follow those three steps I guarantee
you'll have an audience and you'll be able to make
some kind of money through this passive income stuff
But that's quite hard to do no one sticks to it
for at least two years
So we'll give that a 3.5-star rating
But the good news is once you've created it
And once you started making money from affiliates
it's actually quite easy to maintain
because especially if you have evergreen content
the sort that isn't relying on like current affairs
or the latest news the sought that people
might search for over a long period of time
this becomes like relatively reasonable passive income
Now if we look at me and my business
these days from Skillshare we make a roundabout
$11,000 per month in affiliate income
which approximates to around $2,750 per week
And from Amazon on average
like it's around about $450 a month
from the Amazon UK store
and a little bit more from the US and Canada
All right method number five of making passive income
is by selling digital products
Now these are products that you create once like an ebook
or a download or an app or something like that
So you create it once and then you can sell it
multiple times because selling digital products
doesn't usually have any costs associated with it
One really good example is this guy called Traf
who I follow on Twitter who made an iOS 14 icon set
and sold it for like $30 a pop a few months ago
and ended up making I think like $300,000 in the course
of like a few weeks
just because loads of people around the world
wanted to buy his icon pack
So he put the work into creating the pack
and now he's selling it for lots of money
Another example is my YouTuber friend Oliur
who has made as he says $700,000 from selling his
website Tumblr themes since 2014
So he made the website themes for Tumblr
he sells them and he makes $700,000 on average
Well overall since 2014 that's pretty cool
So how hard is it to get started making digital products
I mean anyone can write an ebook
an ebook counts as a digital product
So I'm gonna give this a two-star rating
two out of five stars
but obviously like again money is an exchange of value
So the thing that you're selling you have to be
providing enough value to compensate
to make up for the price that you're selling it for
And that's often quite hard
especially if you don't have any experience
in this sort of field
and how hard is it to make $100 a month
Well you know it's very easy to create an ebook
but it's a whole different ballgame trying to get people
to actually buy your ebook or buy your icon set
or buy your app or buy your website themes
And because the market around this stuff is so competitive
like you have to be genuinely really good
to get people to buy your stuff
And the way you get people to pay you money
for something is that you identify a problem that they have
you solve that problem and then you charge money for it
And if you can do those three things then it's you know
I wouldn't say it's easy to make $100 a month
but it's very doable to make $100 a month
You just genuinely have to have something
that solves a pain point
that other people are willing to pay for
So we're gonna give this a three out of five stars
to make $100 a month from selling digital products
And finally in terms of maintenance we're gonna give this
a two out of five stars because usually
you do have to maintain your product a little bit
but it's often easier to do
like it's much easier to maintain a product
then creating a product in the first place
Idea number six for passive income generation
is to create an online course
Now online course's sort of like a digital product
but generally online courses are in video format
In fact this whole video is so long
it could basically have been an entire online course
Maybe I'll do one about this very topic
And in terms of getting started
we're gonna give the starting difficulty
a two out of five stars 'cause it's not that hard
to make an online course
but generally you do need to know how to do video
So you know you actually could film an online course
on your iPhone or phone whatever phone you're using
if you're one of those Android heathens
Stick your phone on the side
talk to the phone teach something
So it's not hard creating one
but in terms of making $100 a month again
at that point your course needs to actually be good
And the only reason people will pay for it
is if the course is actually good
Now you can avoid having to charge for your online courses
by using a website like Skillshare
who are very kindly sponsoring this video
I have tons of classes on Skillshare
I think we've got nine on them in total
I've been teaching on Skillshare since September 2019
and I've actually just released my new online class
called Productivity for Creators
how to start a successful side hustle
Where I teach you the ins and outs
on how you can well create your own side hustle
in your spare time without quitting your job
If you wanna check this out
then the first of thousand people to click the link
in the video description will get
30% off the annual Skillshare premium membership
This is actually a really good deal
I pay for Skillshare
I've been paying you for it for years
even after I started teaching on it
because it's genuinely a fantastic place to learn stuff
They've got thousands of classes
on all sorts of other topics
but you should definitely check out mine
like the nine that I've got
There are three around productivity now
like the fundamentals of productivity
the sort of productivity equation
which is how I think of productivity
and Productivity for Creators
I have two on how you can study for exams
If you're in school if you've got exams to prepare for
those apparently are really good
they've got very high ratings
And if you've already had a free trial of Skillshare
then you can still use that offer
that if you're one of the first of thousand people
to hit the link in the video description
you will get 30% of the premium membership
and you can check out my class
which I have to say is pretty good
Anyway thank you Skillshare for sponsoring this video
but genuinely Skillshare is a great place to teach stuff
because you can teach things on Skillshare
without directly having to charge for them
Which is why I love putting my courses on Skillshare
It's kinda like having something on Netflix
in that the end-user does not have to
pay directly for the product
And the other nice thing about Skillshare is that it's like
it's sort of like YouTube in that anyone
can upload a class to Skillshare
provided it meets certain quality requirements
And so it's a lot easier
then having to make your own website
and create your own courses platform
and all that kind of stuff
So pretty easy to start
We're gonna give this a two out of five
but how hard is it to make $100 a month
from teaching online courses
Now this kind of depends
If you're going down the Skillshare route
then to make $100 a month in Skillshare
you need roundabout 1,700 minutes of watch time
which is 28 hours of watch time
So if you have a one hour class on Skillshare
you need 28 students to take that class every month
and watch it with a premium membership
roughly very broadly speaking
And that will give you roundabout $100 a month
At least those are based on my figures
over the last like two years of being on Skillshare
Now how hard is it to get 28 people a month
watching your class
Well if your class is actually pretty good
it shouldn't be too hard
to get 28 people a month watching it
If you have an existing audience
it's very easy to get 28 people a month watching it
because people already know like and trust you hopefully
And so they'll watch your stuff and give you a shot
because you've already built that goodwill with them
But again the nice thing about Skillshare as a platform
is that they have like their own algorithm
So the good stuff rises to the top
So if you genuinely have a really really really good class
and you put it on Skillshare
then even if you don't have an audience
there is still a high chance
that if the class is actually good
and people watch it a lot and people recommend it
and give it high ratings it will rise to the top
And it will start getting recommended to people
who find it on the Skillshare homepage
or who searched for it specifically
The other way of making $100 a month from a course
is to just charge $100 for a course
And then if you do that you just need one sale every month
So how hard is it to get one person a month
to buy your course
Well again if it's good you know the world
of online education is exploding so much every year more
and more money's being spent on online education
especially with the whole pandemic stuff
So if you have a valuable skill that you can teach
I think courses are one of the best and easiest
or one of the best ways of making passive income
because it's fun to create a course you can teach stuff
you don't need that many technical skills
like making a website or anything like that
Just shove it on Skillshare
And then people can take your course
and learn on the internet
And like you know it's just cool overall
And the nice thing is that once you've made the course
and once you're making $100 a month from it
maintaining that level is actually quite easy
We're gonna give that a two out of five stars
because generally you don't need to
update the course that often
And you can do that once in a while
and you just need to make sure
you're getting a reasonable amount of traffic to it
And hopefully that traffic will grow over time
These days the vast majority of my online courses
at least the very passive ones are hosted on Skillshare
and it's kind of ridiculous
But these days they make roundabout 60,000
to $65,000 per month in purely passive income
Like I literally do nothing for my Skillshare classes
once I've made them other than a reply to comments
and other than occasionally plug them in videos
And that's like $60,000 a month in passive income
That means this is a roundabout of $15,000 per week
And this makes up the bulk of the $27,000 a week
that this business currently generates
in purely passive income
Idea number seven for passive income
is by creating some call it some kind of paid membership
or community model
Now again this is generally a bad idea
unless you have an existing audience
which we keep coming back to
Like everything becomes easier
when you have an existing audience by creating content
that has been valuable over a long period of time
very consistently
That audience knows likes and trusts you
and so when you say "Hey guys sign up to my Patreon"
then some people are likely to do that thing
The other way of doing a membership
is by creating a value proposition that is so compelling
that people would be willing to pay
for a community-like service for this
If we use Patreon as an example my friend Hannah Witton
who's a YouTuber she's got roundabout
600,000 subscribers on YouTube
And I think she has around 600 Patreons
626 last time I checked which means if we look
at our Patreon stats which are public
she's making somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 pounds
or like 3,000 and $7,000 per month
in passive income from this audience
But it's like 600 people out of an audience of 600,000
So one in a thousand of her subscribers
have signed up to her Patreon
So clearly you know if those stats
are true across the board and they kind of are
if you look at Matt D'Avella Patreon on as well
you need a big audience
to make a significant amount of money for Patreon
Again this sort of depends on
how much you're charging for them
and exactly what value you're providing
Another example of a paid membership community
is my friend Anne-Laure who runs a website called Ness Labs
and they have a paid membership community
which is $5 a month
And she started this when was it in the summer of 2019
She had zero audiences at the time
and she just wrote a hundred blog posts
over a hundred working days and built up an audience
such that in March 2020 when she launched a membership
she had some paying members for it initially
And I think last month she's just passed
$100,000 a year in annual recurring revenue
which is pretty awesome from something
that started less than two years ago
So how easy is it to start a membership program
Well it's actually very easy
We can give this a one-star because it's very easy
to start one you just make an account
on some kind of membership platform like Patreon
But to make $100 a month
you need to provide $100 a month worth of value
And that's actually quite hard to do
We're gonna give that a four out of five stars
but the nice thing is again once you've got that formula
once you're making $100 a month it's actually a lot easier
to maintain it because the way the economics
of membership communities work
it's provided you keep showing up
and providing value in some capacity
you know people have already signed up for the thing
So it's not too hard to maintain that level of support
that you're offering them
For this business we have a membership community
for our Part-Timer YouTuber Academy for the alumni
which is called the Part-Timer YouTuber Inner Circle
And we make roughly $2,800 a week
from this membership community
It's not very passive
We run like three or four events per week
along with like twice a day coworking events on zoom
and we have lots of stuff going on
So it takes a lot of work but $2,800 a week
it's pretty good for a membership community
All right nearly there
So idea number eight for generating passive income
is creating a business that sells goods or services
and then automating or delegating aspects of that business
so that the income that you generate
from it is reasonably passive
This is the stuff that Tim Ferris
talks a lot about in "The 4-Hour Workweek"
where there are a lot of businesses
that you could make where you're selling a good
or selling a service
and then you can delegate outsource automate
and intelligent ways to make the income passive
So again using my friend Oliur as an example
on his YouTube channel he talks about
his $1 million Shopify store
He designs manufactures and sells these really cool
vegan leather kind of desk accessories and bags
and mouse pads and that kind of stuff
And this was loads of work in setting up
but now he's got a team of three other people
that manage the business
And so he spends proportionally less
of his time running that business
And so it's sort of passive income for him
Even though these days he still does spend around
10 hours a week maintaining things
Equally if you're going down the service route
I've got a friend who runs an Instagram
and Facebook ads marketing agency
where he has clients who pay him some
I think a few hundred dollars per month
to manage their Facebook and Instagram ads
And for him it's like a small amount of work initially
to set up the Facebook and Instagram ads
but then it's sort of automated
and he's got a team around it
And he's used using things like Zapier
to automate aspects of that business
so that each month he has to do a very small amount
of actual work to keep it ticking along
So these are different ways of generating passive income
from a kind of goods or service-based business
But it's quite hard to get started with this stuff
To get started we're gonna give this
a four to five-star rating because again
you need to create a business
and it's quite hard to make a business
that genuinely provides value
Equally we're gonna give it a four out of five-star rating
for making $100 a month in revenue
Because again you have to be able to provide value
and providing value is hard
Like it's not as easy
as making an account on a stocks platform
and just putting some money in
You actually have to give value to people
which is kind of hard
But the nice thing is once you get started
like with anything maintenance is a little bit easier
So we're gonna give that a three out of five-star rating
Finally idea number nine for generating passive income
is to build an app or a website
or some kind of software product that you can offer
either as a one-off or more likely these days
as a subscription service
And there's a whole category of this called SAS
software as a service
Now if you look at the website indiehackers.com
there are like literally hundreds of examples of people
who have built software businesses
that are making passive income
and they share their revenue numbers
and they tell you how they got started
and they give you their tips
In fact I was recently interviewed on an episode
of the Indie Hackers podcast which is really cool
'cause I've been listening to it for years
and it's like following the website for years
And I was interviewed around the concept of starting
an online course like the Part-Timer YouTuber Academy
Now I've had a bit of personal experience with this
So when I was at university I made a website
called BMAT Ninja and UCAT Ninja
So software as a service it was a question bank
for medical applicants applying to medical school
to help them do well in the admissions tests
And this was something that me and my brother
coded completely from scratch
He and I both know how to code
we learned when we were young
And so we worked over the summer of 2015
to make these things happen
I think in year one we made about $10,000
and in year five last year
it was around $25,000 from BMAT Ninja
So you know it's pretty good money
but it was a lot of work to set these things up
And so in terms of starting out
I'm gonna give this a five out of five-star rating
because to make an app it's actually quite hard
You have to know how to code for the most part
you have to be able to offer something compelling
and you have to actually build it which takes a lot of work
and it's very hard but it's a lot of fun
And then once you've made it
I'm gonna give $100 a month difficulty a four-star rating
Because again it's easy well easy enough (laughs)
You can make an app but then getting people
to pay for the app is an entirely different kettle of fish
So we're gonna give that four stars
But the nice thing is like with everything
maintenance is a little bit easier
so we're gonna give that a three-star rating
