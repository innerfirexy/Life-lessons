- Okay so if you spend any amount of time on YouTube
you've possibly wondered at some point
how much money do these YouTubers actually make
Is it related to how many views or how many subscribers
or all these different factors
So in this episode of Oversharing
I'm gonna break down
exactly how much money I make from YouTube
and I'll be explaining how this whole thing works
So that if you wanna get into it you can
Or if you're just really curious
you can indulge your curiosity
We'll start by talking about the logistics
of how people actually earn money on YouTube
and how it works
And then we'll talk about the three main factors
that affect how much an individual earns on YouTube
And then we'll go under the hood
and I'll be exposing all of my analytics
for the last three years
so you can see how much money I really make
So to start making money on YouTube
you first have to join the YouTube Partners Programme
which means these days
you need to have at least a thousand subscribers
and 4,000 hours of total watch time on YouTube
So you can't start monetizing
the instant you turn on your channel
Once you've hit those landmarks
then you can apply for the programme
and if you're approved for it
you can then turn on ads on your videos
This is optional but when you turn on ads
and people would probably usually see a five-second ad
before the video
and might see some mid-roll ads during the video
and possibly a five-second ad after the video
And the idea is that YouTube sells these ad slots
to advertisers through their Google Ads programme
So advertisers can then pay to show their ads
on different types of content
and they might wanna do it
based on a whole lot of different factors
Now the problem is that when you are very small on YouTube
you actually aren't really earning very much money at all
and I recognised this
So for me when I started my YouTube channel in June 2017
I made 77 videos before I turned on monetization
I think I turned on monetization roundabout April 2018
because to my mind
making five or $10 a month from YouTube
was just not worth the annoyance for the audience
in watching the ads
But if that number was gonna be $500 a month
at that point it would be worth subjecting the audience
to the annoyingness of ads
because it was making me a significant amount of money
And so for example from June 2017 up until April 2018
I had 340,000 views
8,300 subscribers
and I made one pound 96 in total across that
But then when I turned on monetization
for the next six months
from April 2018 to September 2018
in total I made 6,106 pounds and 42 P
So that's the logistics out of the way
Let's now talk about the three factors
that affect how much money you earn on YouTube
And the most important of those is actually watch time
So watch time is quite important
both from a revenue perspective
and also from a YouTube algorithm perspective
So from a revenue perspective
it's important because the longer
people are watching your videos
the more opportunity they have to see ads
But from a YouTube algorithm perspective
watch time is interesting
because although no one quite knows
exactly how the YouTube algorithm works
the YouTube creator team have hinted
a lot of it is based on watch time
If your videos are making people watch for longer
and also stay on YouTube as a platform for longer
then your videos are more likely to be recommended
by the algorithm
And so that's partly why these audience retention graphs
that we see in our YouTube Studio these are so important
And if we look at my four previous videos
you can see the audience retention graphs
are really not very good
For most of these videos
even for the ones that I think are pretty good
we're dropping off to about maybe only one in four
or one in five people are actually watching
all the way through to the end of the video
And you can see there's a significant decline
right at the start
Usually this is because people click on a video
within five seconds they realise that can't be bothered
to watch the video so they go away from it
So you get this precipitous decline
And then you get a general decline
as you go through the video
which just shows that there's nothing in particular
that's making people click away from it
It's just that people are slowly attritioning over time
In fact some people say that the more viral a video gets
the less your audience retention is gonna be good
For example in one of my recent videos
called How I Type Really Fast
which amazingly went viral
loads of people watching that video
are people who don't know who I am
They're not subscribed to my channel
Therefore they're a lot less likely to watch
17 minutes of me spouting on about something or another
which is why the audience retention graphs
for that particular video look so abysmal
even though that video had a lot of views
Let's have a look at some of my more popular videos
and we can see how watch time relates to revenue
So for example
if we compare the video of My Productivity Desk Setup
with the video of Which iPad Should You Buy
the desk setup video has made about 1700 pounds
with 1.4 million views
and the iPad video has made 2,246 pounds
with 1.3 million views
So that's kind of weird
The iPad video has made more money
even though it has fewer views
But if we look at the watch time
the desk setup only has 75,000 hours which is quite a lot
but the iPad video has 124,000 hours
So it's about a 50% increase
But then on top of that
we also have an extra feature which is mid-roll ads
This was something that Google and YouTube introduced
a few years ago
and that meant that on any video above 10 minutes
you could have mid-roll ads
So sometimes those are ads
that are those little option banner ads
that appear in the middle of video
At other times they're more annoying
like five second ads that interrupt your video
(guitar music)
that you have to skip
and then you can watch the rest of the video
But crucially this only applies to videos
that were over 10 minutes long
And so a lot of YouTubers realised this
and started kind of artificially inflating
the length of their videos to make it more than 10 minutes
For example if we take a look
at my YouTuber friend and colleague Shelby Church
she's done a video where she breaks down
how much money she makes off YouTube
and she looks at the difference
between a nine-minute and a 10-minute video
And she found that her videos that are over 10 minutes
earn over three times as much revenue
as the videos that are under 10 minutes
So it makes such a big change
which is what kind of incentivizes YouTubers
to have longer videos
just so they can get these mid-roll ads in
And actually recently in the last couple of months
YouTube has made a change
whereby you now only need it to be eight minutes long
before you can start adding mid-roll ads
So I suspect people are gonna be less keen
to inflate above 10 minutes
and now a little bit more keen to inflate
above eight minutes
So the second thing that determines
how much money you're gonna make is the type of content
And that's what dictates the CPM or cost per mille
which is Latin for like cost per thousand views
or something like that
And the CPM changes on a lot of things
but mostly it's based on how much advertisers
are willing to pay to target a certain type of video
And so depending on the topic
you would get different rates
So let's say I make a video about I don't know
a fantasy book that I like
The sorts of companies that are advertising in those videos
probably don't have a lot of money
They're probably book publishing companies stuff like that
Whereas if you were to make a video about finance
or real estate or credit cards
the companies that advertise on those sorts of videos
have loads of money to burn
And so your CPM rates are gonna be higher
So in general for most YouTubers
the CPM is around three to $7 per thousand views
But if you pick the right sort of video topic
it can go up to about 30 or $40 per thousand views
which is absolutely huge
For example most of my videos
are in the three to seven pounds range
But if we look at Shelby Church's video
where she talks about how to make money
using Amazon's FBA Fulfilled by Amazon programme
that's a prime video for advertisers to target
because it's a video about making money online
and therefore loads of people who have courses
about making money online
are gonna target that particular audience
And we can see from her channel that she says
her playback-based CPM was $35.60 cents
which is absolutely enormous
And so she's making more than 10 times as much money
as she would be making on a different kind of topic video
just purely based on the choice of topic
Unfortunately the CPM doesn't actually go to the creator
YouTube tends to take a 45% cut of CPMs
And so if your CPM is $10
you're actually only gonna get $6.50 off that amount
And that leads to a new metric
that they've recently introduced called RPM
which is revenue per mille
And that is a more accurate idea
of how much money you as the creator
are taking home from these videos
The third major thing that influences
how much money we make on videos
is the role of sponsors
Now essentially if a video is sponsored
then at some point during the video
the creator is gonna make some kind of spiel
So for example
I might say that if you want to start your own journey
of making money online
one of the best ways of doing that
is by learning how to code
To learn how to code
you should start by teaching yourself HTML and CSS
And then you should learn
a server side language like Python
And actually the best way to learn Python
is by following an online course over at Brilliant
who are very kindly sponsoring this video
If you don't know Brilliant is an amazing platform
with online courses for math science
and computer science
and their introduction to Python and advanced Python series
is actually a really good interactive fun way
of learning how to code in Python
And then once you learn how to code in Python
you can basically build anything from a simple website
all the way through to machine learning algorithms
It's one of the most popular programming languages
in the world and Brilliant is a great place to learn that
They've also got fantastic courses on math and science
They've recently got one about uncertainty
which is all about kind of navigating probability
in an uncertain world
So if that sounds up your street
you should definitely head over to brilliant.org/ali
and the first 200 people to click that link
will get 20% off the annual premium description
So thank you Brilliant for sponsoring this video
That's an example of a sponsored message
And so Brilliant are gonna pay me
a certain amount of money for plugging that within my video
and that massively changes how much money
I'm gonna be making from this video
A few things kind of complicated
So firstly most contracts with sponsors
say that you're not allowed to say
how much money you're making from them
So I'm not allowed to tell you how much money
Brilliant have paid me to do that particular sponsor plug
But with some channels like Casey Neistat for example
he says he makes between 10,000 and $100,000 per video
- As in like more than $100,000
- Even though he's absolutely huge
he's a lot bigger than I am
But it just kinda gives you an idea
of the numbers that get thrown around
And in fact a lot of huge YouTubers
make more than $100,000 per sponsored video
which is just insane
So we've talked about the different factors
that influence how much money YouTubers make
Let me now take you inside my YouTube Studio
my YouTube Studio app thingy
and I'll show you how much money I've been making
from each of the videos
and we'll talk about that a little bit more
So this is the lifetime revenue of my YouTube channel
since about June 2017
when I first started uploading videos
And so we can see that for the first absolutely ages
I'm making sometimes one penny per day
but basically I'm not making anything until April 2018
I think it was 17th April
I remember this day when I turned on monetization
And so now I'm going from making absolutely nothing per day
to making 11 pounds eight pounds nine pounds 16 pounds
So immediately having already been a YouTuber
for like nine months at this point
and having made 77 videos already
I'm now making sort of between five and 15 pounds a day
off of YouTube ads
which at the time was pretty great
I was already feeling like I was winning at life
because that pays for a takeaway every single day
if I want to
And that just felt like it kind of felt like cheating
that I can basically eat for free
now that I have a YouTube channel which was quite nice
So we can see in May 2018 16 pounds 72
and then kind of dropping down to three pounds
three pounds 68 10 pounds
And then we start in June 2018
I think this was when I made my iPad video
Yeah this was a special video
How I Take Notes on My iPad at Medical School
But as soon as that video comes out
suddenly my revenue skyrockets
from five pound 91 and four pound 69 a day
all the way up to sometimes 60 pounds a day
and 40 pounds a day and 70 pounds a day
And again this really felt like cheating at the time
because I was like I can't believe
I'm making this much money off YouTube
I'm making like 50 pounds a day
That was like 1500 quid a month
and that just felt again like this is amazing
I'm making real actual money from YouTube
It's not just a few pennies here and there
This is 1500 pounds a month
This is actually a large amount of money
Over time we can see it doesn't really change much
for the next year
So for around 12 months after that
I was sort of hovering between the
making a few dozen pounds a day off of YouTube ads
which was still pretty good
But then over time
we can see that the graph really starts to increase
So throughout 2019 the rate bumps up a bit
So some days I'm making over a hundred pounds a day
which is again absolutely insane
And then we've got a 97 88 95 100 100
all the way through to September 2019
And then what's really cool about this graph
is just how much of an exponential rise it's been
over the last six months
Basically since lockdown started
So I think kind of lockdown was pretty good for me
and the YouTube channel because now all of a sudden
loads more people are watching
sitting down and watching videos
And now we can see that these days for example
Friday the 3rd of July 578 pounds in a single day
That's pretty good
Sunday 23rd of August 2020 711 pounds in a day
If you told me a couple of years ago
I was gonna make 700 quid in a day from YouTube ads
I would literally have had a stroke
and I would've thought no go home
This is not this is not gonna happen
It's a very much like an sort of slow and steady
slow and steady and then all of a sudden
it starts to grow
And that's only really happened in the last six months
It's one of those weird things
whereby it almost feels like playing a video game
where your character starts off kind of on level one
and you can't kill anything
And then you can start kind of killing some stuff
But then at some point
you get to kind of what feels like the end game
where your character starts getting a lot more powerful
and suddenly you can just kind of do all these things
that you couldn't have done before
And that's kind of what it feels like
on the sort of exponential growth of YouTube revenue
And if we kind of put this down to the last 28 days
we see yeah estimated revenue
in the last 28 days 11,618 pounds
Whereas estimated revenue of the lifetime
was about 90,000
So in the last one month I've made about 10%
11 12% revenue compared to the last three years
which is pretty good going
And we can see here that the CPM the cost per mille
is five pound 50
but the actual revenue per mille is only one pound 68
and that's because loads of people have ad block
It's because YouTube takes a cut
and all these different factors
So yeah last 28 days 11,618 pounds
This is pretty good
For context my junior doctor salary
was about 3000 pounds a month pretax
This is also pretax
So this is three and a bit times more
than my monthly doctor salary
If you wanna see how much money I've made
from other sources that video
How Much Money I Make in a Week as a Doctor on YouTube
it will be linked to the little playlist over there
along with a couple of other videos
about how to make money online
and how you can get started
on this journey of #passiveincome
Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video
Bye bye
(upbeat music)
