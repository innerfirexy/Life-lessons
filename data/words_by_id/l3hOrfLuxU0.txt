- Hey friends
Welcome back to the channel
Happy New Year all of that good stuff
If you're new here my name is Ali
I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge
And in this video I wanna talk about
15 life lessons that I learned in 2019
All of these are things that I've mentioned
in some capacity or another in my weekly email newsletter
So pretty much anytime I come across any
interesting life lessons that I find useful
I share them in my email newsletter every Sunday
So you can sign up with the link down below
But yeah here is a roundup of 15
of my favourite ones from 2019
Let's go
Firstly I learned about the importance
of setting a daily highlight
And I came across this in a book called
Make Time by John Zeratsky and Jake Knapp
And they suggest that every day
the way to be productive is to have a single daily highlight
that you're gonna be working on for that day
So that's either something that's gonna
bring you the most joy something that's the most urgent
or something that will bring you
the most kind of satisfaction when you do it
And I've started actively tracking this
in the app Notion for the last few months
And I find that on the days where I remember to set myself
a daily highlight I inevitably get more done that day
Just because I then have this default activity
that I know I'm gonna be doing
So that was a really important lesson that I learnt
Secondly we have a quote from Kurt Vonnegut
who is a famous writer
And he says "And I urge you to please notice
"when you are happy and exclaim or murmur
"or think at some point
"'If this isn't nice I don't know what is.'"
And I first came across this kinda towards the end of 2019
And kind of on reflection I realized that
I'm very quick at moving from one thing
to another thing to another thing
and I very rarely take the time
to appreciate and kind of like enjoy the moment
And since I came across this quote
I've really started to actively do that more
Like let's say I'm driving in the car
and I've got a latte in my hand
and I'm listening to something on Audible or whatever
then I just occasionally have the thought that
if this isn't nice I don't know what is
Or let's say I'm on my desk and making a video
or filming something or trying to learn something
or running a supervision for my students
I just like to think
if this isn't nice I don't know what is
And it's that subtle encouragement for me
to be more grateful for the things in my life
So yeah thank you Kurt Vonnegut for that quote
Thirdly I came across this idea of
window openers versus door knockers
It's not quite the terminology they used
in an episode of the My First Million podcast
that I first heard this on
but I kinda synthesized what they were talking about
and turned it into window openers and door knockers
And the idea is that in life
there are two sorts of people
There are the window openers and the door knockers
The window openers need to look through a window
and when they see their expected outcome on the other side
then they open that window and they walk through
Whereas the door knockers are the sorts of people
that will knock on lots of doors and open those doors
and see what's on the other side
So the key difference between those is
for the door knockers you don't know what
the outcome of your action is going to be
You have to knock on the door and see
Whereas for the window openers
you see the outcome on the other side
and you just kind of work through it to get it
And the point that they were making in this podcast
that really resonated with me was that
in most things in life these days
a lot of the success disproportionately
comes from the door knocker attitude
rather than the window opener attitude
There are still some traditional careers
like medicine and stuff
whereby you have your path charted out in front of you
and any action predictably leads to a certain outcome
But in all of the rest of bits of life
and a lot of business a lot of creation
like starting a YouTube channel
you don't know what the outcome is going to be
You just know on the door you apply consistency
and hard work and dedication and all that good stuff
and you then gain the opportunity for serendipity
that you never would have known was possible
If you'd asked me two and a half years ago
"What's the point of starting a YouTube channel,"
I wouldn't have been able to articulate
I would've been like oh I don't know
I'm just gonna do it consistently
and I hope someday it'll go well
And now it's completely changed my life
and I wouldn't have been able to do that
if I'd been a window opener if I'd just been thinking
oh let me focus on my medical career
because that's the thing that I can see in front of me
Point number four is this idea by Derek Sivers
which is that what is obvious to you
might be amazing to others
Now whenever we're in any sort of
sharing of ideas kind of field content creation
this sort of stuff making videos
writing blog posts writing books
recording podcasts and stuff we have this thing
We all have this thing that
oh I'm not gonna share this idea
because it's just kind of obvious
Surely everyone would know about it
This first lesson that I shared
about the daily highlight at this point
because I've incorporated it into my life
it's pretty obvious to me
that if you wanna be more productive
you should set yourself a task to do each day
And if you don't then what's the point
But that idea when someone comes across it
who hasn't heard it before it's pretty revolutionary
It's like oh my God that's incredible
Equally for some of you watching this video
when I talked about
"If this isn't nice I don't know what is,"
you might have been thinking
oh come on mate that's obvious
Everyone knows that
But when I first read it I was like oh my God
this idea has actually changed the game for me
because it's now made me more happier
It's encouraged me to feel more gratitude
So the point that Derek Sivers makes in his blog post--
Again link in the video description
Is that don't worry that what's obvious to you is
gonna be obvious to others because it probably won't be
And so as a lesson to all of us
we can and should share the things that we've discovered
the things that we've learned
the 15 life lessons that we learnt in 2019
because what's obvious to us might not be obvious to others
It might even be amazing to others
Point number five: in 2019 I really began
to appreciate the value of lifelong learning
So I recently became a physiology supervisor
at Girton College Cambridge University
where I teach 10 medical students
every week about human physiology
and that's meant that I've actually had
to learn all this stuff all over again
and kind of explore it in more detail
That's actually been really fun
It's been one of the most kind of joyful activities
in my life kind of sitting with the books
and with the PDFs and papers and stuff
and trying to figure out what the best way
to teach this sort of topic is
And actually the UK government I found
commissioned this study which was an analysis
of all of the benefits of lifelong adult learning
So people who learn stuff actively in their adult life
and there are all sorts of benefits
So they've said "Adult learning can indirectly
"improve wellbeing and lead to positive outcomes
"in health and socially positive attitudes and behaviors,"
amongst loads of other stuff
So yeah I really began to appreciate
the benefit of lifelong learning
And one other way that I've been trying
to do this lifelong learning thing
is by doing online courses on Brilliant.org
And Brilliant is an amazing learning platform
targeted at maths science and computer science
And they've got online classes from
all sorts of things within those categories
like probability number theory algorithms
data structures AI neural networks
All this sort of stuff
I've personally enjoyed taking
their computer science courses
Now I actually considered applying
for computer science rather than medicine
but I sort of reasoned at the time when I was 16
that it would kinda be cool to be a doctor
who knows how to code rather than to just be a coder
But that meant that all of the coding
that I've done has been sort of very hodgepodge
and I've never quite taken the time to understand
the fundamentals of algorithms
the fundamentals of how computer science work
And that's what I've been doing on Brilliant
which has been really helping on that front
They've also got this really cool new
daily challenges feature on Brilliant
whereby every day there is a new daily challenge
and that introduces some concepts to you
Whether it's maths science or computer science
And then it gives you a problem in which
you have to kind of take that concept a little bit further
and try and apply your new learning to it
And then they give you the solution and kind of explain it
And it's A a really good way of
generally exercising the mind
And I find that it's also a good model for me
to build my own teaching sessions around
because the idea of tutorials and supervisions
at universities like Oxford and Cambridge
is that you would give the student
a small amount of information
You'd kind of give them the basic building block
and then you would ask them a question about it
that kinda tests that a little bit more
And so it kinda takes it a little bit further
And then you see how far they can go
and then add some more knowledge
And it becomes this iterative process
whereby hopefully you kind of learn together
and build on someone's understanding
rather than by just kind of regurgitating something at them
like I'm currently doing in this video
So that's one of the great things about
the daily challenges feature on Brilliant
So if any of this sounds up your street

social and economic wellbeing

So thank you very much Brilliant
for sponsoring this video
Right so point number six is this idea of a flywheel
Now I first came across this in a Jim Collins interview
on the Tim Ferriss show I think
In engineering terms a flywheel is like a device
that stores mechanical rotational energy
But in terms of business and creation and YouTube
and entrepreneurship and all the stuff
that I'm interested in outside of medicine
the idea of a flywheel is that it's
something that takes ages to get going
But when it gets going then it kind of
builds on itself and is unstoppable
And people often use the flywheel analogy
to describe how Amazon works
So for example they get really low prices
and that leads to people wanting to buy stuff from Amazon
which leads to sellers wanting to go on Amazon
which means that Amazon
then have this supply and demand thing
which means they can drive prices lower
Overall this one thing leads to another leads to another
leads to another on this flywheel
that takes a lot of effort to get going
Amazon's been going for years now
But then it becomes completely unstoppable
because each thing kind of builds on itself
And the way that I've applied this flywheel concept
to my life and I've started thinking about it
is in terms of things like YouTube
and podcasts and making a blog
At the start when you're starting a YouTube channel
you get basically no one viewing your videos
and you might get one extra subscriber a day
and you feel super proud
"Oh my God I've gone from 47
"to 48 subscribers in two days that's incredible."
And no one's watching your videos
But the more you can kind of produce hopefully valuable
content consistently over a long period of time
the more the flywheel gathers momentum
And the weird thing about YouTube
and the cool thing about YouTube
is that the algorithim is very flywheel-y
in that the more videos a YouTuber creates
the more opportunities there are for other people
to discover their content the more they're likely
to subscribe the more watch time they're gonna get
the more the algorithm benefits you
and starts recommending your stuff in suggested videos
And it kind of drives this wheel that
keeps on going and going and going
But the point is that it takes
so much effort to get started initially
And anytime I'm sort of in that mode
where I'm thinking oh this is too much effort
I think no it's a flywheel
If I'm starting something new then I know it's gonna
take that effort to get started to begin with
Point number seven is I discovered
this idea of mastering boring fundamentals
and I got this from a blog post
by a guy called James Stuber which was entitled
Master Boring Fundamentals: Boring Is Fun
I just wanna read a few things from it
So firstly he says "For any endeavor
"there are a set of basic skills
"needed to build a strong foundation."
"These are the boring fundamentals."
"Sleeping eight hours a night exercising consistently,"
"eating your vegetables meditating reading books
"writing for yourself and for your peers."
And then there are domain specific fundamentals
like drilling guitar cords
or calculus if you're into maths
He says that "Even when we know they're good for us
"even when we know that they'll advance our goals
"we avoid taking the steps needed."
"We don't do the boring fundamentals
"because well they're boring."
"Repetitive actions done day after day
"are not a recipe for excitement."
"There's a disconnect between the future
"positive result and the present slog."
"Progress often plateaus
"and only arrives in unpredictable bursts."
And this sorta goes back to this idea of a flywheel
in that we have to do these boring fundamentals
and he's kind of making a broader point about life
You know sleeping eight hours a day
exercising eating your vegetables
I don't even do these boring fundamentals
I don't sleep eight hours a day even though I want to
I don't really eat vegetables
because I'm just terrible at cooking and my diet is awful
And I don't really exercise consistently
because I always feel like there's
something better I could be doing
And the reason for that is because it's boring
It's a fundamental and the rewards don't come immediately
Whereas if I think ooh
I could go home and film a video that results in a video
and that's like immediate gratification
Whereas if I think ooh
do I wanna go to the gym for two hours
or do I wanna actively go to the shops
and cook some vegetables to just improve my life in general
That's got less of an obvious benefit
And so reading this kind of stuff reminds me
that I need to master the boring fundamentals
and this is something that
I've tried to actively think about more
That's sort of encouraged me to go to the gym a bit more
and to eat a little bit more healthily
and to really take care of my sleep
Point number eight is another idea
that I found from James Stuber's blog
and that's the idea of type one versus type two fun
When we think of fun we often think that there's just
the hedonism the pure unadulterated joy type of fun
Oh playing video games is fun or playing sports is fun
But for something like running a marathon
or climbing a mountain or doing cross country skiing
we probably wouldn't consider that fun
because it's not the same sort of fun
But in this blog post he talks about this
kind of long distance skier called Tim Peck
who defines a type two fun
which is where it's suffering in the present
but then it's sort of fun in hindsight
And that's a different sort of fun
And that is sort of the sort of fun
that I noticed that being a doctor
when it's really really busy is like
It feels very grueling when you're there
But then at the end of the day you look back and you think
oh that was actually a really good day
It's definitely not pure hedonism
when you're trying to kind of treat someone
and there's emergencies going on
and you're struggling to keep up with the workload
but it is definitely fun and it's a type two kind of fun
And so just understanding recognizing this distinction
between type one and type two fun
has been really helpful for me
because now I have the vocabulary in my head
to think about the sort of fun that takes some suffering
I now appreciate why some people say that running is fun
because previously I used to think
how on Earth can running be fun
Because it's not as fun as playing squash
But actually it's just a different sort of fun so yeah
Point number nine is something
I came across on Tim Ferris show
He interviewed a guy called Safi Bahcall I think
I can't remember his credentials
I think he wrote a book
Ooh maybe he wrote a book called Loon
Maybe that's it
I'll link it over there if that's the case and down below
This guy Safi is a writer and he talks about
how there are a few different modes of writing
And the first one is FBR which stands for fast bad wrong
And he says that when you're doing your first draft
just think to yourself "This is going to be fast
"it's gonna be bad and it's gonna be wrong."
And just having that mindset encourages us
a lot more to actually just put stuff down on paper
And so for me every time I'm writing
my weekly email newsletter I initially have
that kind of writer's block where I'm like
oh I don't know what to write
'cause I don't know if this is gonna be good
But then for the last few months
since I first came across this
I've been actively writing down FBR on top of the page
Just to remind myself okay this is just a first draft
It's gonna be fast it's gonna be bad it's gonna be wrong
And that means that I can just kind of write
without worrying without judging myself
without worrying about the quality
Inevitably at the end of it I've written something
and then I come back to editing it
and I think oh actually this is kind of reasonable
Or if it's not then I edit it
But it's a lot easier to edit once you've got
a fast bad wrong thing than that thing that
we as writers or as creators always try and do
and try and get it right on the first draft
So just appreciating this and having this kind of
vocabulary to define fast bad wrong
has been really helpful for me and my writing career
And again plug to my weekly email newsletter
You can sign up with the link down below
Point number 10 is something that I came up with
just completely made up one day
for my weekly email newsletter
But I've started to apply it a lot more
and that is the Reitoff Principle for productivity
For me I kinda struggle with..
It's not a bad struggle to have
But I kinda struggle with switching off
Like when I get home from work let's say it's 9PM
I would think oh I've got two hours before bed
I should probably film a video
Even if I'm really not feeling up to it
even if I'm feeling really tired
and I know I'm not gonna do great work
I just think you know what I should film a video
And that's fine
Consistency's important and all that stuff
But there are a lot of days whereby I kind of
procrastinate from filming the video at 9PM after work
and I just kind of lay on my sofa
just scrolling through Instagram and I don't do anything
Like I wouldn't get out a book and read it
Or recently I wouldn't stop playing on my Nintendo Switch
because I would be feeling guilty about
not making the YouTube video and not doing the work
And so the idea behind the Reitoff Principle
is that sometimes it's okay to just write the whole day off
And once you've written the whole day off
you've decided that you know what
I'm gonna give myself a break today
Which means that at least for me
I find this helpful because then I don't
have to feel guilty about not doing anything
There was a day a few weeks ago where I was doing this
I was sort of sitting on the sofa behind there
and my housemate Molly was sitting next to me
And I was just like "Oh Molly I need to film a video,"
"but I can't be assed."
And she was like "Ali haven't you written
"something about the Reitoff Principle?"
"Why don't you just make it a write off day?"
And I was like "Oh my God Molly you're right."
"This can be write off day."
And then it just brought so much joy to my life
that I didn't have to film a video that evening
that I just kind of dropped my phone
got out my Nintendo Switch
and played The Witcher 3 for like two hours
But it was two glorious hours and I wouldn't have had
that joy had I not kind of written the day off
So yeah the Reitoff Principle
If you wanna read more about it I'll put a link
to my email newsletter where I talked about it first
But yeah that's point number 10
Point number 11
God this video's getting really long
If you're still here I apologize for being so ramble-y
I'll try and speed up
Point number 11 is the mundanity of excellence
And this comes from a paper that I read
which is from like the 1970s or 80s
You know like old
Old school like boomer level territory
Where the author talks about what defines excellence
and he studies the field of swimmers
So he looks at competitive swimmers in the local
club national and Olympic levels
and tries to figure out what's the difference between them
And he realizes that the difference between them
it's not a quantitative difference
It's not really that Michael Phelps practices that much more
than someone who's a club or a county level player
It's that the people who are at the really pro
end of the excellence spectrum
they do things qualitatively differently
And the point he makes is that it's all just very mundane
Like they actively put a bit of effort
into figuring out their technique
they wake up on time every day and do it
they look after their diet
There's nothing really sexy about the way
that these people get really good at stuff
It's just that they just do the mundane repeatedly
and just kind of do it consistently
And kind of reading this it's a really long paper
but I read the whole thing 'cause it was a riveting read
It made me realize that we're always
on the lookout for some kind of shortcut
I fall into this myself
I'm guilty of this spreading the good news
about the latest productivity app
But really the latest productivity app probably
isn't gonna make much difference to your life
What will make a difference to your life is just
doing the boring fundamentals repeatedly
and the point that this guy makes in his paper
is that excellence is ultimately a mundane phenomenon
There's nothing sexy or exciting about it
It's all just very mundane
It's all just doing the right things consistently
and trying to get a little bit better each time
But I thought it was a very interesting read
and a good lesson that I took away from it
Point number 12 is the Go First rule
and I first came across it--
I don't know where I came across this several years ago
But I've sort of ingrained it into my life
But it really stood out to me
when I was in Sudan this time last year
When you go to a new place you probably know
there's always that kind of little bit of
meeting new people and needing to break the ice
And what I read in this book
that I really can't remember where it's from
is that everyone is friendly
but you have to be willing to go first
Because if you go first if you take the initiative
to say hello and introduce yourself
and strike up a conversation
you will find that people are just generally nice
and everyone's really friendly
And so in Sudan for a few minutes
I was like "Ehh everyone's kinda shy."
"Everyone's kinda quiet."
"I don't really know what to do."
But then I started actively
going up to people and kinda saying hello
and just kinda generally having a chat
This going first that I did on my part if I can say so
I suddenly appreciated how friendly everyone was
and people were so happy to talk to me
and it was just really nice
A really really good experience
And I think my experience in Sudan would've been a lot
less fun had I not gone first with those sorts of things
And I think this just applies generally
across the board as well
When I'm at work I try and go first
in introducing myself to new colleagues
and kind of initiating banter a bit when I can
and inviting people to things
Just being able to take that fear of embarrassment
and internalize it within ourselves
and just forget about it and just go first
means that we see just how amazing humanity is
This sounds really corny
How amazing humanity is how friendly people are
and how willing people are to connect
as long as we go first
Point number 13: high leverage housekeeping
This is an idea that my brother came up with
which is that every Saturday what he does is that
instead of doing active work on his thing
he does what he calls high leverage housekeeping
Which is that kind of sorting out the email inbox
sorting out the to-do list cleaning the desk
sorting out the project management software
I think he uses Notion to manage and track his own startup
and figuring out what needs to be done
Spending a few hours on a Saturday
to just get your life in order
Sort of like what Amazon used to do in--
Apparently there was one year
just before they hit a billion in revenue
where the mantra for the whole year was GOHIO
G-O-H-I-O: getting our house in order
And the point of the whole year was to kind of focus
on the systems and make everything work really well
not try and create new things
And so what I try and do now is that every now and then
I try and do this weekly
But it ends up not being weekly
I think about having a whole day
dedicated to high leverage housekeeping
where I can do things like make decisions about what
I wanna be doing for the next weeks or the next month
or actively planning new video ideas
Whereas otherwise I'm just in kind of technician mode
I'm just kind of doing the thing
I never really take the time to step back
and figure out where I can apply leverage
where I can do some housekeeping to make things
scale better grow better be more fun
That sort of stuff
So high leverage housekeeping
Again link to all of these in my email newsletter
if you wanna have a read in more detail
Point number 14 is this idea of
having an inbox for your brain
And this is from David Allen's book Getting Things Done:
The Art of Stress-Free Productivity
which is just kind of like the bible for productivity
about how to get stuff done
But the main thing I take away from this is that
it's really important to have an inbox for your brain
Basically a place where you can capture ideas and things
as soon as they hit your brain so that you can then
offload them from your brain and into this inbox
So these days I use the app Drafts for that
So any time I have an idea for a video
or a quote or literally anything I'm thinking of
either on my Apple Watch or on my phone or on my Mac
I will open up the Drafts app
and just write a quick note for that
And that means that when I'm doing
my high leverage housekeeping
and my weekly reviews or whatever
then I can convert the Drafts items
either into Notion projects or into to-do list items
if they need to be done urgently
or I can just kinda file them away in my archives
And it's nice having this inbox for my brain
because it means that my brain is then
for having ideas not for storing them
And that's the idea that David Allen
talks about in his book Getting Things Done
Again link in the video description
And finally point number 15 is the power of project lists
So again I only really started doing this
after reading Getting Things Done for the third time
And the idea is that you should have a list
of all of the projects that you're currently working on
and that you want to be working on
So after reading this in the app Notion
I made like a project list of
all the video ideas that I might have
and all the videos that I was currently working on
And just the fact that I had all of that stuff written down
meant that my brain was doing this background processing
of these various projects as I was going about my day
and just not even realizing it
or even maybe when I was asleep
So sometimes I genuinely wake up in the morning
and I'd be like oh that idea for a video
that I had ages ago that I wrote down on this project list
I've just thought about something to make that happen
Or if I'm driving to work in the car
and listening to an audio book or listening to a podcast
occasionally I just have an idea that references
some of the projects that I've got on my list
and I didn't really have that
before I started writing this sort of stuff down
And so I'm a real big believer of having
a list of projects that we're working on
And that's not even in the video front
It's just kind of in life in general
And the way that David Allen defines that is that a project
is anything that has more than one step required to do it
So now I've got a whole list of projects that I'm working
and I find that that's really helpful
And that's been the final lesson that I learnt in 2019
So that was a roundup of all the things
that I learnt in 2019
In fact it wasn't all of them
It was like 15
Pretty much all of them I write
in my weekly email newsletter
So for all 52 of them check out Email.AliaBdaal.com
Link in the video description
You can have a look in my weekly email newsletter
You can subscribe if you like
but that is where I share all of the things
in real time as I discover them
But I thought I'd do this annual roundup
just 'cause a few weeks ago
I was making my annual review video and I thought
oh this is a list of 15 things
life lessons I've learnt this year
Why don't I just make it into a video
So that was kind of where the idea came from
Yeah thanks for watching
