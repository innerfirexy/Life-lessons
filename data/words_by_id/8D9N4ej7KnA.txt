what's up guys kurt you here from
actingcareercenter.com today i just
wanted to give you a quick tip about why
every single audition is a win even if
you don't book it now before we get into
that topic because we're talking about
auditions i just want to say if you are
new to my channel if you haven't
downloaded my free 10 step audition
preparation guide yet you can get it
from that link right up there i call it
my audition cheat sheet and it's my way
of helping you prepare for your audition
so that they can be the best that they
could possibly be and that can
definitely help you in preparing for
auditions like what we're talking about
today so why is every audition a win
even if you don't book it well for a
couple of reasons number one
every audition is a win because of and
i've talked about this before how
competitive this industry is
this is probably the most competitive
profession in the world acting
and simply because of the sheer numbers
i don't know any other job where there
are thousands of people competing for a
single job
and that happens in the acting world all
the time
for any role in a movie or tv show there
are sometimes thousands of people that
are being submitted just to get
auditions and casting directors don't
have time to watch thousands of
auditions for every single role so
oftentimes they can only extend audition
and invitations to maybe 50 or 100
usually less than 10 percent of the
people who request an audition are given
one simply because of the numbers they
just don't have the time so that's why
if you're in that less than 10 percent
of people that receive an audition then
that's a huge win right you you are
already ahead of the game if you get an
audition at all
number two another reason why every
audition is a win even if you don't book
is because
every time you audition
it's an opportunity to build a
relationship for it's an opportunity to
build trust from the person who is
watching your audition whether that's
your agent or casting director or
producer or director or anybody in the
industry who's watching your audition
you are building that relationship every
time they see you on camera and then
even if you don't book that particular
you're staying top of mind for
all of those people every time that they
see you i like to think about auditions
kind of like a commercial it's a
commercial for your acting ability and
every time that commercial plays meaning
every time you audition and every time
someone sees it
you stay top of mind it's kind of like
in our own lives right the more that we
see a commercial for a product or a
store or something like that we tend to
think about that more and then in our
everyday lives if we see that brand
that brand that we've seen a commercial
for over and over again
we tend to trust more because we've seen
it more
in the commercials or
on tv or whatever it may be so
for your auditions the more that you do
it even if you don't book
the more that they see you you're
building that relationship you're
building that trust between you a great
example is the show i'm currently
working on right now so earlier this
year in 2021 i auditioned for a pilot
for one of the lead characters one of
the series regulars on this pilot for a
television show i didn't end up getting
it but i got fairly close uh meaning i
was pinned for the role they were
checking my availability i was actually
pretty excited that i was going to get
this role but then ultimately i didn't
get it it went to somebody else right
and sure i was bummed about it for a
little bit but i also understood that
once this pilot got picked up if it got
picked up which it did
if the show got picked up and they
started shooting the rest of the show
then i was pretty confident that i would
get more auditions for this show why
because if my audition was good enough
to get to the point where the casting
directors and the producers thought that
i should be pinned for it and i was in
their top group their top choices
ultimately it went to somebody else but
i knew that now that they're shooting
the rest of the show
they would probably keep me in mind for
other roles on the show which is exactly
what happened and now i'm currently
working on that show because they are
now shooting the show and i got another
audition as i thought i would
simply because when i auditioned for it
earlier this year and i didn't book it
but i built that relationship with the
casting directors and the director and
the producers so that now they gave me
another audition i booked that role and
i'm currently working on the show i had
a very similar story happen to me on
cobra kai i've told this story before
but if you haven't heard it
when i auditioned for the show cobra kai
i think i auditioned two or three times
and i didn't book any of those initial
auditions and then later on they offered
me a role that ended up being the
character of george who happens to
appear a couple times in season one and
then maybe in upcoming episodes but
the point is that those first few
auditions i didn't end up booking them
but they were all wins because they
continued to build my relationship with
the casting directors of the show and
the producers of the show and the
directors and
on my first day that i worked as the
character of george on the show
one of the producers told me he said hey
we really loved your previous auditions
you just didn't necessarily fit those
characters and that's why we offered you
this role of george because we had seen
those previous auditions of yours and we
really wanted to get you on this show so
next time you get an audition first of
all celebrate the audition itself and
then second of all i hope you book it
for one but if you don't don't get so
down on yourself understand that simply
getting that audition and doing it was a
win and the fact that you
sent that audition in and they saw you
and they watched your acting ability
that's a huge plus because you're
building that relationship and think
about it as the stepping stone to your
next audition the stepping stone to your
next booking just because you didn't
book that particular audition it's not a
big deal because you are that much
closer to booking your next one all
right i didn't have time to finish this
video in my trailer so we are finishing
it up here at home we're talking about
how every audition is a win right and i
showed you a couple examples from my own
acting career now i want to take it a
step further and talk about how
you also shouldn't turn down auditions
simply because you feel like you don't
fit the role and this happens all the
time in in the acting actor's career
for example you may get an audition at
some point where the description of the
character is totally different than who
you actually are
maybe it says
the age is 40s or 50s and you're only in
your 20s or 30s or maybe it's just a
different ethnicity than you or even a
different gender than you this happens
all the time and a lot of novice actors
they'll look at it and they'll say well
why am i getting this audition why would
my agent send me this audition or why
would the casting director send me this
audition i'm not 45 or i'm not
african-american or i'm not caucasian or
whatever right this could happen to you
and sometimes actors would just say well
i'm not going to audition for this
because i'm never going to get it
because i don't fit this character
a reason why you should a couple of
reasons number one
you don't know what's going behind the
scenes when i say you i mean all of us
all of us actors we don't know what's
going on behind the scenes from the
casting standpoint what the casting
directors the information that they
currently have may not be the current
information that's on
the casting breakdown or the character
what happens a lot is that the character
description may have been written when
the when the script was originally
written however as they moved along in
the casting process sometimes those
things change for example sometimes the
casting directors and the director and
the producers will get together and
they'll decide well you know what this
character was originally written for
someone in their 40s or 50s however
it it totally would make sense if that
character was in their 20s or 30s as
well so
let's open it up to a wider pool of
actors and then they extend auditions to
other people but they may not have had
time to update that character
description that gets sent out so you
look at it and you're thinking you got
that audition by mistake but in
they sent it to you on purpose
there were decisions that were made
after the fact to decide to open up the
audition to a wider pool of actors this
has happened to me multiple times i've
gotten auditions for
roles that were written for someone in
their 60s or 70s and
i don't look like i'm 60 hopefully i
don't look like i'm 60. and
i've i audition for it anyway and then
come to find out that it was because
they decided to open up the role to
someone a little bit younger and i ended
up booking the role i've also auditioned
for roles that were originally written
for a caucasian character but then they
decided well this character doesn't
necessarily need to be caucasian so they
open it up to people of other
ethnicities as well so i auditioned for
it even though the description of the
character never changed
the casting directors and producers made
that decision after the fact okay so
that's a reason why you should always
audition anyway even though you feel
like you may not fit the description of
the character when it comes to you
another reason why you should audition
anyway even if you feel like you don't
fit the description is
exactly what we were talking about
before right where
every audition is an opportunity for you
to show them your work show them your
acting ability and
just because you don't book that
particular role doesn't mean that you
may not book future roles and sometimes
what they do with
auditions is that they send out one
audition for one character and they use
that to cast multiple roles
let's say for example that they want to
a few different
customers at a store but they maybe only
will send out one audition of one role
and have everybody read for that role
and they would use that audition to cast
multiple different
and because of that
they will cast a variety of actors but
maybe that role description is only of
one particular type of customer
hopefully that makes sense and this
happens all the time as well and it's
happened to me
in my career too so those are a couple
reasons why you should never turn down
an audition simply because you feel like
you don't fit that character description
because you never know from the casting
standpoint exactly why they're giving
you that audition so always take that
opportunity to show them your work no
matter what all right so that's it for
