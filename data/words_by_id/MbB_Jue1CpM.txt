you know there's one thing that actors tend to do in auditions
that is so different from what real human beings do in real life
that it ends up making the audition look fake
and that the last thing that you want as an actor is to look fake
right so what's this terrible thing that actors doing they're
staring at their partners way too much
Kurt from small-market actor dot com and in this video I'll talk about why staring
at your partner looks so
fake and what you can do to avoid making that mistake so that your audition stands
out above the rest
so let's set the scene here in a typical audition where there's a conversation
between two people
the actor that's auditioning stands in front of the camera
while the person reading the opposite lines usually stand next to the camera
right out of frame so when the auditions starts
what do most actors do they maintain eye contact
with the person is reading the other part the entire time
now think about this for a second when you're in a conversation with someone
are you looking at their eyes 100 percent of the time when you're talking to them
no that almost never happens in real life studies have shown that we maintain
eye contact about
eighty percent of the time when we're listening to someone else speak
but that number dropped to between 40 and 60 percent of the time
when we're the ones talking so unless it's a deeply
intimate scene like exchanging wedding vows people rarely lock
eyes throughout the entire conversation in fact
if someone didn't do that in real life for an extended period of time
you probably be creeped out by them I will stare into the depths of
your soul so why do
actors tend to do this well I can't speak for everyone but I can tell you
the reason
I used to fall into this trap you see when I first started auditioning
I felt like I needed to show a connection with my scene partner
and I thought that by maintaining eye contact it would show how
fully engaged I was in the conversation and in the scene
little did I know that my plan would totally backfire
instead of looking like a human being engaged in a scene
I looked like an amateur actor with no clue how to make a conversation
look real I eventually learned that what I was doing was
wrong but not before blowing a bunch of auditions
another reason actors tend to maintain eye contact the entire time
has to do with the audition space itself most audition rooms are
pretty empty with just a camera and a light or two there's nothing in there to
distract
actors now this is both a blessing and a curse
it's great because we don't want a bunch of distractions when we're in there trying
to concentrate
and nail an audition but it also sucks because in real life
there is life going on around us there are distractions
everywhere and we react to them even if it's
for a brief moment let me give you an example let's say the scene that you're
auditioning for takes place in a restaurant now
if you were in a real restaurant there would be plenty of things going on around
you
right so say you're in a real restaurant having a conversation with someone across
the table from you
meanwhile a new customer comes walking through that door and
you are momentarily distracted as you look over briefly
and then come right back without missing a beat in the conversation we do this all
the time in real life don't we
unfortunately the audition room is a far cry from a real restaurant
in fact short of a police interrogation there are not too many real-life
scenarios that an audition room could believably represent
so since there's no life going on around us
in the audition room we almost can help but look at our partner and maintain eye
contact throughout the entire conversation
so those are a couple reasons why a lot of actors tend
to fall into the trap of staring at their partner the entire time
now let's talk about a couple things that you can do to avoid making that
mistake so that your auditions
standout the first thing that you can do is to take some time to think about what
you're gonna say
you know how we sometimes look off into the distance and
think about what we're gonna say before we talk
we do this in real life because we don't
have all our dialogue pre-planned out our conversations are spontaneous
but when we have a script we already know all of our lines so it's easy
to just fire them all out like a machine gun because we don't have to think about
what we're saying as actors though we need to make
our conversations look unscripted and spontaneous
so go through your script and see if you can find the parts where it would make sense
to pause for a moment before you said your next line
another thing that you can do to avoid staring at your partner the entire time
is to imagine your surroundings before you begin your audition
briefly close your eyes and imagine the setting of the scene
if it's a restaurant scene like we talked about before take a moment to really
picture everything going on in that restaurant in your mind's eye
this will increase your awareness of all the life that's going on around you
and when you start your audition make sure to stay aware of
everything around you and allow yourself to momentarily look at the waiter or
look at the crying baby
or the wall decorations now you don't have to overdo it if you just do this
every once in a while and take your gaze away from your partner
for just the second and then come right back you'll make your conversations look a hundred
times more realistic
alright so those were couple tips to help you avoid the
mistake of constantly staring at your partner for the entire audition
