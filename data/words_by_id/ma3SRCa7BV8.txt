what's up my fellow actors kurt you here
as you can see we're not in my normal
atlanta home studio today that's because
i'm on the road right now i'm actually
out of town filming a movie
which i talked about in my video last
week and i have an
off day today so we are recording this
video here in my hotel room
today we're going to be talking about
talent agents a few months ago i made a
video called four ways to get a talent
if you're interested in that video i'll
put a link to it down in the description
but in the comments of that video i got
so many questions
asking me do i need a talent agent to
become an actor and because that's a
question that kept coming up
i thought i'd make a follow-up video and
try to answer that question here
so do you need a talent agent to pursue
an acting career
well the short answer here is there are
many things that you can do
before getting a talent agent in fact
there are many things that you should be
doing as an actor
before getting a talent agent however
there are some
huge huge benefits to having a talent
agent at some point in your career
so let's first talk about what you
should be doing and what you can be
doing without a talent agent
as i mentioned so many times before in
other videos the first step to pursuing
an acting career is training it's not
getting an agent
getting an agent is down the line but
it's not the first thing you should be
training is the first thing you should
be taking acting classes you should be
learning how to act
you should also be taking audition
classes you really need to know how to
audition talent agents are going to be
looking for that when they're deciding
whether or not to sign you now if you're
interested in learning how i audition
i've actually put together
a free 10-step audition preparation
cheat sheet which is the process that i
actually use
when i get an audition so if you want to
download that for free you can go by
clicking that link right up there
other things that you can be doing for
your career without a talent agent is
networking you should be learning about
the business you can be doing plays to
get experience community theater you
should also be submitting
yourself for independent films or
student films or short films things like
commercials even some some of those
things are posted publicly on casting
websites such as
actors access or backstage or casting
there are projects that are going to be
posted publicly so that you
without an agent can go onto those
websites submit your headshot
and try to get auditions and audition
for those types of projects so if you're
a brand new actor who's just starting
out those are
all the things that you can be doing
prior to getting an agent in fact those
are things that you should be doing
prior to getting an agent because those
things will help you stand out more when
you do eventually submit to an
agent because they want to see someone
who's already dedicated to their career
and if they see that you've been doing
all these things already
you look more like a professional actor
rather than the person who submits to
them and says hey i'm brand new i don't
know anything but i want you to
represent me
right they're going to push that person
out the door and they're going to give
you much more consideration because
you've been taking all these steps
before you submit it to the agent so now
let's say you're an actor who is doing
all those things let's say you're even
booking some of these auditions that
you're getting off of these public
casting calls
why do you need an agent then if you're
already booking well the truth is
those public casting calls represent
only a small
fraction of the actual number of paid
acting gigs available the vast
majority of professional acting work
only goes through agencies and are not
posted publicly so we're talking movies
television shows commercials even
industrial videos and training videos
the vast majority of those are not
posted publicly
they are only going through agents and
agents are sending those auditions
to the actors they represent so unless
you have representation
you're not seeing any of those auditions
so that is a
huge benefit to having an agent because
getting opportunities that you otherwise
would not have gotten
if you were not signed with them so now
you might be wondering why don't they
post those auditions publicly why do
they only give them to talent agents
well the answer is that casting
directors know that if they post an
audition publicly for instance
let's say they post an audition for a
marvel movie to the general public
well they're going to get bombarded with
submissions from all kinds of crazy
people saying hey i want to be part of
your movie
and they have no acting training they
have no idea how to audition they don't
have a head shot or a resume and
they have no idea how the business works
and yet they just want to be part of the
so one way to get around all of that is
only give those auditions to talent
agents so that they can guarantee
they're only getting auditions
from professional serious actors another
huge benefit of having a talent agent
is that now you have someone on your
side someone on your team
who understands the industry who has
industry experience and knows the ins
and outs
of negotiating contracts and whether or
not you're being treated fairly if
you're being paid fairly if you're
getting taken advantage of
because let's face it when we're first
starting out we have no idea if
if we're doing everything right for
example let's say
you got an audition for a commercial and
it pays three hundred dollars and it's
going to be on tv
a lot of brand new actors will look at
that and jump on that opportunity
because they say
wow i'm gonna pay am getting paid 300
bucks and i'm going to be on tv this is
but then they find out somebody else did
a similar commercial
and they got paid five thousand dollars
for it when we're first getting started
we have no idea what we should be making
what is a fair wage and that's where a
talent agent can be really helpful
because they've been doing this for a
long time
they've negotiated contracts for actors
they've seen commercials being done and
they know how much
someone should be making for a
particular job so you won't get
undercut you won't get taken advantage
of when you have someone with experience
on your side
another way that an agent can help you
is through their guidance
as you progress in your career you might
hit some roadblocks where you don't know
which way to turn
and this is another situation where the
agent's experience comes into play and
can help you out
even if it's indirectly they may not
have the exact answers for you but
remember they represent an
entire roster of actors and potentially
they represent another actor
who's faced your problems before who's
hit those roblots before
and push through them so the agent can
then connect the two of you
and now you have someone else that can
help you out as well so now let's get
back to the original question
do you need an agent to become an actor
well as we've said in the beginning when
you're just starting out you definitely
don't need an agent right away in fact
you shouldn't be pursuing an agent right
there's plenty of stuff that you should
be doing prior to getting an agent
however as you move forward in your
career there's going to come a time
where you will definitely need to pursue
agent in order to move forward in your
because it's going to be virtually
impossible to take those next steps
to audition for those bigger projects
without having an
agent on your side i certainly wouldn't
be where i am in my career right now had
it not been for the great agents i've
worked with over the past
10 plus years all right that's it for
this video

until next time keep practicing keep
and i hope to see you on set one day
