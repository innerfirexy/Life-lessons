if you are watching this video it means
you are thinking about embarking on the
journey of becoming a professional actor
in film and television
as a working actor in the industry i
want to help you
and point you in the right direction let
me first tell you that
this journey certainly won't be easy in
you're going to find that an acting
career is quite the roller coaster ride
full of
highs and lows and successes and
but ask yourself this what in life
worth pursuing is ever easy like they
if it were easy everyone would do it so
if you are the type of person who
believes in following a dream
and beating the odds and proving
naysayers wrong
then keep watching this video because
we're going to talk about
the 12 steps every actor needs to take
to jump start their career and i
encourage you to watch this
entire video because look i know this is
longer than the typical three minute
youtube video
but i encourage you to watch this whole
thing because
every single one of the 12 steps is
extremely important
step number one is to start training now
is the first step for every aspiring
training will also be an ongoing process
for the entirety
of your career i'm approaching 15 years
in the industry and i still take classes
all the time to
sharpen my skills and to find new tools
to add to my tool belt
but when when we see award-winning
actors in movies and television shows
they make acting look so easy and
effortless now why is that it's not
because they were born with it
it's because they have decades of
training under their belt
so where should we start well if you're
in high school
start with something available in school
like your drama club or school plays
if you're in college look for theater
classes if your
college offers them and if you're out of
school and you're currently working a
day job like i was when i first started
then maybe you can look for acting
classes available
after work hours or on your days off
this also applies if you're a student
too you can find
acting studios that have classes
available for
teens maybe after school the point is
no matter how you find these classes
find the classes and start
training now a quick google search for
acting classes in your city
should turn up some acting studios in
your area step number two is to start
building your network your entire career
is going to be built on relationships
this whole industry is built on
the power of your network is much more
than just
the people that you know it's the people
that they know
and and the people that those people
know that's why a network is so powerful
it's because it extends much further
than our own
personal reach what one day someone in
your circle is going to hear from their
network about a role that
they think oh i know who would be
perfect for this
and they're going to call you up and
they're going to tell you about roles
that you never knew existed
i mean that's the power of a network
right so make sure you start
making those connections now if you've
already taken
if you've already started taking acting
classes then
you've already started building your
network because your teachers and your
classmates are going to be some of the
important connections that you will ever
make especially
early on in your career because they can
start giving you advice
on agents and headshot photographers and
all kinds of stuff
and remember that relationships are a
two-way street
so don't invite people into your network
just so you can get something from them
be the type of person to offer to help
them out in any way you can as well
so if you hear about a role that you
know one of your classmates is perfect
then tell them about it be the type of
person that helps
people out and then your network is
going to be stronger
for it i'm going to tell you a story
about how i was once offered
a moo a role in a feature film and i
never even auditioned for that movie
how was i offered that role because one
of the producers on the movie
i had worked with in the past before
that happened
i thought that type of thing only
happened to movie stars
but no it happened to me and that's the
power of a network you never
know when a relationship is gonna pay
step number three is to learn how the
business works
if you haven't heard anyone say it
already then let me be the first to tell
that being an actor is like running your
own business
you don't want to be a one-hit wonder
right you want to have a
long lasting career so when it comes to
building a successful career you have to
understand that your acting ability
is only one piece of the puzzle it's an
important piece
but it is still only one piece of the
puzzle so
once you learn how to manage your career
like the ceo of a company
and understand how all of the pieces fit
then you're really going to understand
how you
fit into the industry so where should
you start to learn about the business
well in my opinion the number one
resource on the business of acting
is this book self-management for actors
by bonnie gillespie
i know that many college acting programs
have this book as required reading
and for good reason it's the most
comprehensive guide to navigating the
industry that i have
ever read so i will put a link to self
management for actors
down in the description below step
number four is to get professional
every business needs a marketing plan
and an actor's most important marketing
is their headshot your headshot is the
first thing that anyone in the industry
sees of you so it's very important to
make a good
first impression so what makes a good
headshot well
many factors but i'll tell you what in
my opinion is the most important thing
and that's it must look like you
so on the day of your headshot session
overdo your makeup and when your
headshots are done
don't photoshop the heck out of them to
the point where they don't even look
human anymore
a critical mistake that an actor makes
is that
when you walk into the audition room and
you don't look like your headshot
if i go into an audition and i don't
look like this
the casting director is gonna be pissed
off because this is who they called in
to audition
not someone who doesn't look like this
and also please please please
go to a professional headshot
yes it's going to cost some money it's
probably going to cost more money than
you want to spend
but you have to look at it as a business
in your career if you cut corners here
and you get headshots that look
amateur agents and casting directors are
not going to take you seriously
imagine if i were a lawyer and i gave
you my business card
and that business card was printed on
regular flimsy computer paper
and it was cut out with scissors would
you take me seriously as a lawyer
of course not and that's what it's like
when an actor walks in the room with a
headshot that was not taken
by a professional photographer you want
to be an actor
invest in your headshot because it is
your most important marketing tool
step number five is to create your
resume your acting resume will always be
requested along with your headshot
if it's digital then your headshot will
be a jpeg file
and your resume will be a pdf document
if they want a physical headshot and
then your headshot will be printed on
8x10 photo paper
and your resume will either be printed
on the back or you'll print it on a
separate piece of paper
and staple it to the back when you are
first starting out
your resume will not have a lot of stuff
on it and that's
perfectly okay we're all starting from
right so what do you put on your resume
in the beginning well
put all of your acting classes on there
you should tell people what you've been
you can also put on if you've done any
in high school or college or community
put those plays on your resume as well
you can also put on special skills
that has a section on your resume as you
start to do more and more work
as you start to do web series or student
films or independent films
those all start to add credits to your
resume one quick tip
background work does not go on an acting
so if you've been an extra in a movie i
don't care how big the movie was i don't
care if it was avengers end game
that does not go on your acting resume
if you put background work on your
resume it's going to make you look like
an amateur and again
agents and casting directors are not
going to take you seriously
so take that background work off your
now step number six is to create your
online casting profiles
now that you have a professional
headshot and resume
it's time to set up your online casting
if you are in north america the two most
widely used
casting platforms are actors access and
casting networks
you can set up free accounts on both
platforms and
your profiles on these websites are
going to serve kind of as
an online resume for other people in the
to see you can also browse publicly
posted casting calls on each website
now not every city uses casting networks
actors access to the same degree the
major production cities like los angeles
new york and atlanta
use them heavily but if you live outside
of north america
or if you live in a city that doesn't
use these websites
then you're going to have to find out
what casting platforms
are used in your location if you're in a
small market
sometimes that's just going to be a
facebook group where they ask
actors to post their headshots and
resumes my advice would be to start with
your network
ask your teachers ask your fellow
students ask
other working actors that you know where
they are finding local
casting calls and one more thing at some
point you're going to want to create an
imdb profile but you don't need to do
this right at the beginning
i would recommend that you wait until
you have a few credits on there
before you shell out the money for that
step number seven is to learn how to
self tape auditions
self taping has become an absolutely
essential skill for any actor who wants
to make a career out of this
what is a self-tape well i think we're
all familiar
with how the traditional casting process
where the actor goes into the casting
director's office we wait in a waiting
room until we're called in
and then we go and audition live and in
in front of the casting director well a
self-taped audition is when an
actor records their audition at home and
then uploads it to the casting director
instead of going live and in person
here's an example
of a self-taped audition that i did at
if janet starts throwing around reckless
criminal negligence if she starts trying
to demonstrate that
you were somehow responsible in any way
even indirectly then these types of
headlines they don't help us
we don't engage
they got this from your statement to the
i wasn't thinking clearly that night we
lean on well we can't unring this bell
fine they can rip me to pieces they
don't get to take bites out of the kids
okay i'll do it your way
fortunately self-taping is not rocket
science and with a little bit of
you can definitely start getting good at
this i've put together a list of tools
to help you
start recording high quality audition
videos at home
i've put a link to that list down in the
description below
step number eight is to start
auditioning for indie
films student films and theater
now that you have training and you have
a headshot and you have a resume
and you know how to record your own
auditions it's time to start
auditioning for real stuff yes you can
start auditioning for things without
having an agent
casting websites like actors access and
casting networks
have publicly posted casting calls that
you can
self submit for but remember to select
the right region when you are submitting
so don't submit for projects in toronto
if you live in miami now there are pros
and cons when you're working on
student films and non-union indie films
but in the beginning
the pros far outweigh the cons
many of these projects are going to be
unpaid or
very low pay but just like in any other
sometimes you got to take that unpaid
to show the world what you are capable
of at this point in your career you're
going to be needing audition experience
on-set experience and demo reel footage
more so than
anything else and yes audition for plays
as well even if your ultimate goal
is to work on camera acting in plays
can be an invaluable experience that
will serve you for the rest of your
and there is another way to get
experience without auditioning and
working on
other people's projects and that's to
start creating your own projects
so start creating your own web series or
short films in my acting classes me and
my friends would always create our own
one it's a lot of fun two we're always
learning something new
and three we're creating demo reel
footage that we can use for ourselves
step number nine is to create your demo
now once you've worked on your first
project hopefully you've got some
footage back that you can put onto your
demo reel
now don't worry if your demo reel is
only one short scene
that's perfectly okay just like with
your resume our demo reel has to start
from somewhere if you happen to have
multiple scenes or you worked on
multiple projects
great you can put all of that onto your
demo reel now the rule of thumb
is to keep your demo reel on the shorter
side so
90 seconds to two minutes long max
that's because agents and casting
directors are only going to watch about
that much anyway in fact
they're probably only going to watch the
first 20 to 30 seconds so you want to
with your best content and don't fall
into the trap of
thinking that your best acting is
necessarily your most
emotional scenes i've seen so many demo
reels start off
with 30 seconds of only crying or 30
seconds of just
screaming and yelling and anger that
doesn't necessarily show us that you can
it shows us that you can cry and it
shows us that you can scream
but don't underestimate the power of a
scene of a simple conversation with
someone if you can listen and respond
truthfully and do it in the moment
and make it look real that can be a
fantastic scene for a demo reel
step number 10 is to submit to your
first agent
all right you've probably been wondering
when we were gonna get to an
agent the thing is most people will want
to jump to this step
right from the get-go because they think
getting an agent right away is going to
turn them into a working actor but
that's not how it works
agents don't turn people into actors the
same way
hospitals don't turn people into doctors
hospitals hire people who have already
put in the work and proven themselves
ready to become
doctors so by the same token agents sign
who have already done all of the
previous steps and have
proven themselves to be ready for the
what does an agent want to see when you
submit to them
well they want to see people who are
really serious
about this as their career they want to
see that you've been taking classes they
want to see that you are still currently
taking classes
they want to see a professional headshot
and a professional resume
and they want to see a demo reel of your
and then if they like what they see then
they may invite you
in to audition for representation now
once you do sign with your first agent
first of all congratulations but don't
take this
as an indication that you can take your
foot off the gas
a fatal mistake that a lot of actors
is that as soon as they sign with an
they uh sit back and relax and they
i can just wait for my agent to call
they're gonna do all the work for me now
no that's not how it works at the end of
the day
you are still the biggest stakeholder in
your career
you need to continue to train and to
continue to network
and to continue to update your marketing
and to continue to submit yourself on
casting websites
and do all of those things because look
your agent only takes a 10
commission off of anything that you make
right so that means
90 of the work is still on your
step number 11 is to branch out to a
bigger market
unless you already live in one of the
big production hubs like los angeles new
york or atlanta then
at some point in your career you're
probably going to consider
moving to a bigger production market
this is a huge decision and should not
be taken
lightly and it should not be made on a
i've seen too many actors move to a new
without really giving it much thought
they only found out after the fact that
they just weren't prepared
for the mental or the emotional or the
financial struggles that they would
so please do as much research as you can
and make a plan before you make the jump
the next question is where should you
move and well
that's going to be a very personal
question because
nobody's going to be able to make that
decision for you
i started my acting career in cleveland
ohio back in 2008 and in 2016
i decided to move to atlanta instead of
los angeles or new york
and that has turned out to be a really
great decision
because atlanta has offered me
incredible opportunities that i would
never have dreamed of when i was in
now could i still move to los angeles at
some point in the future
yeah that's definitely a possibility but
at this moment i am
100 focused on building my career
here in atlanta now i've made another
about moving to atlanta for your acting
and i'll post a link to that video down
in the description below
step number 12 is to be patient and
enjoy the journey
yes the process is probably going to
take a long time it's going to take
longer than you expect but the more that
learn to enjoy the process the happier
you will be trust me on that don't tie
your happiness
just to the outcomes that you're looking
forward to in the future
learn to enjoy the process this
reminds me of one of my favorite
it's not about the pursuit of happiness
it's about
finding happiness in the pursuit
and i think this totally rings true to
the pursuit of an
acting career all right that is it for
this video
