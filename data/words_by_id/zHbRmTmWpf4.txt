what's up my fellow actors kurt you here
from actingcareercenter.com
a lot of people have been asking about
acting resumes so in this video i'm
going to show you what my acting resume
looks like
and then i'm going to open up a blank
document and you can follow along as i
create an example acting resume
step by step and section by section so
you know exactly
what to put on it now before we get
started if you haven't already make sure
to subscribe to this channel to get more
videos on
acting auditioning and career advice
every single week
okay let's learn how to create an acting
all right here we're looking at my
current resume you can see the standard
three column format now i'm going to
show you how to
make a resume like this regardless of
your experience level and we're gonna
start step by step
and build it piece by piece we're
starting with a blank resume the first
thing that you have is your name and big
bold letters right at the top it could
be left justified it could be centered
it could be right justified i'll leave
that up to you
i like having it on the left underneath
your name should be your union status so
in the united states you are either a
after a member in which case you would
write sag-aftra right down here
or you are non-union in which case you
would write
non-union right here so remember this is
a film and television resume so if you
an equity member for theater that
doesn't really apply here so you are
a sag-aftra member or you are non-union
and that goes right underneath your name
underneath that should be your
statistics so i have my height
and then my hair color
and then my eye color
hair color and eye color are pretty
standard on a resume there is some
debate over whether or not to put your
height i think it's fine because in the
vast majority of auditions the casting
director asks you to slate your height
so i don't think it's really that big of
a deal to put your height on your resume
some people
like to leave it off but i'll leave that
up to you as well
underneath your statistics you have to
have your contact information
now if you have an agent you would put
your agent's contact information if you
don't have an agent you would just put
your own
so here we're assuming you don't have an
agent so you would put your own phone
and then an email address
your name at gmail.com whatever it is
some people don't like to give out their
phone number in which case you can just
have your email address but you really
need at least one or the
other because they have to have some way
of getting in touch with you if someone
looks at your resume and wants to
get you an audition or wants to book you
for a project
they need to be able to get in touch
with you in some way shape or form
if you have a website you can put that
here as well
so www.yourname.com whatever your
website is
okay so this is the standard top section
of a resume it needs to have your name
it needs to have your union status
it needs to have your stats and some way
of contacting you
all this information needs to be at the
top of your resume remember if you have
an agent then it has to be your agent's
contact information
not your contact information you don't
need both you need
one or the other okay now let's get into
the actual credits
section of your resume the first credit
section should be television credits
now if you don't have tv credits right
now that's totally fine
everybody starts with zero credits right
but i want to make sure that you know
how to add a television credit to your
resume when you do
i have full faith that you will at some
book a television show and now i'm going
to teach you how to add that credit
to your resume now i'm going to put this
in bold i want to put all the title
sections in bold
underneath this we're going to do this
three column formatting now the first
column is the name of the show
so let's say you book a role on stranger
you would put the name of the show and
then on the second column i'm going to
hit the tab
key on my computer to move over to a
middle column so i'm going to hit it
like three times and then here we would
put our billing
so for television shows your billing is
either co-star guest star recurring
or series regular i'm not going to get
exactly what all of those means in this
video because that would make this video
way too long
just understand that costar is a smaller
character guest star is a bigger
recurring means you're in multiple
episodes series regular is one of the
lead characters of the show
how do you know what to put on your
resume well that is dictated by the
so when you book a role on a television
show your contract will say if you are a
a guest star a recurring character or a
series regular okay
so right now let's assume that you
booked a role on stranger things and you
were a co-star that's why we would write
co-star here in the
billing section and then we're gonna
move over three more tabs and the third
and final column here is going to be the
network name or the streaming service
in which case this will be netflix
and then i will also put the director
so let's assume this was directed by the
duffer brothers
who are the creators of stranger things
so that
is one line of a resume for the
television section
we're gonna put one more line down here
just so you can see how this works
the walking dead for instance
and let's say for the walking dead you
booked a guest star
and then the walking dead is on amc
and let's say the director was greg
okay so those are two lines on a resume
a television section i'm gonna add a
couple more lines right here by just
copying and pasting so it doesn't take
as long
but now you can see what the billing is
for co-star guest star recurring or
series regular
one thing that you'll notice is that for
the recurring and series regular lines
we don't list the directors and that's
for most television shows the director
changes episode by episode so if you are
on multiple episodes you wouldn't have
room here to write 15 different
directors on this line
right so when you are a recurring
character or a series regular
you tend to leave that blank and just
have the name of the
network or streaming service moving on
after television would be film
so again we're going to bold this
so here the formatting is exactly the
same we're using the three columns
so assume we were in star wars
now for the second column of the film
section we don't use the same co-star
guest or recurring
stuff that we do for television because
that doesn't make sense for a movie
so here we write either lead supporting
or principle
i'll go into that in a second here let's
just finish off these three columns
the final column for the film section is
the name of the director
spelled his name wrong
so george lucas the name of the director
for star wars now i'm going to add
a few more columns here by just copying
and pasting
to save some time and then i'll explain
what these sections are so here the
first column is pretty self-explanatory
it's the name of the film
here like i said lead supporting or
so let's just use star wars as an
example the lead character
if you played luke skywalker in star
wars you would write lead on your resume
if you play a character like yoda
who is not the lead character but is a
pretty important character in the movie
he is a big supporting character you
would write supporting and
for principal principal is just any
other principle performer who isn't a
lead or a supporting character
continuing with the star wars example
one of the stormtroopers who has one
line and
then gets shot and killed he would just
be a principal performer in the movie
and then finally the last column is the
name of the director so as we see
our four credits here we have star wars
lee george lucas black panther
supporting ryan coogler
lore principal kate shortland and then
this final line in the film section i
want to show you how you can add a short
if you were in a short film you would
also put it in the film section you
would just put
short in parentheses this is the way
they do it on imdb so i just copied that
so assume you were in a short film
called tiny dinosaurs you would put it
on your resume like this if you were the
lead character and then
and then the name of the director is
ellie sattler hey if you're getting
value out of this video do me a favor
and give it a thumbs up
and by the way this example resume that
we're creating right now
i'm going to put a link to it down in
the description of this video so you can
copy and paste it
and create your own acting resume off of
this template
and if you have any questions remember
to ask them down in the comments below
alright let's get back to it now one
important thing to understand
for an acting resume is that background
work does not
go on an acting resume if you were
background in a movie or you are an
extra on a television show you do not
put this
on an acting resume so i do not want to
see any resumes that say
for instance game of thrones background
okay i know a lot of people are
desperate to
show experience on their resume to
look more like a professional but it's
actually gonna have
the opposite effect if you put
background work on your acting resume it
makes you look
unprofessional because it looks like you
don't know what you're doing
professional actors understand that
background work does not go
on an acting resume all right moving on
to the next section
is web series these are the types of
credits that most people will start off
with these are the things that you shoot
with your friends these are the things
that you shoot with
people in acting class you write your
own projects you produce your own
you film them and then you edit them
and then you put them up on youtube or
instagram or facebook or wherever
but these are just like independent
shows that don't go
to a major network so let's assume you
created a web series called
the white house and then we would use
the same type of billing that you use
in a television show so i'm gonna put
guest star
and then we would put the director so
let's say the director's name was donna
so if you were in a web series that you
created with your friends that you put
up on youtube you can put this on your
resume this is
the right way to add credits to your
resume and not
use background work now the next section
is theater
a lot of people will start out in
theater before they move into film and
tv so this is something that you can put
your resume even though it is a film and
tv resume having theater credits stuff
does add some credibility so let's say
you were in
uh a couple shows i'm gonna copy and
paste again so it doesn't take as long
to type
so let's say you were in a couple shows
romeo and juliet you play juliet little
women you played amy
the three columns here are again the
name of the play
here you would write your character this
is the only time on an acting resume
where you actually write your character
look at the television film and web
series credits you actually write your
billing co-star guest or recurring
series regular lead supporting principal
lead guest star
right in theater is the only time where
you actually write the name of the
character the third column in the
theater section
is the place where the production was
put up so
if you did the show in school you would
write the name of your school in this
case i put the university of arizona
if you did it in a local theater you
write for instance big house theater or
whatever the name of the theater was
that you actually did the play now one
thing that i want to mention with
theater is that a lot of people have
done plays since they were very young
they've done plays since they were in
elementary school
through middle school through high
school through college and beyond and in
those cases they may have
30 40 or more credits
there can be a desire to put
all of those credits onto your acting
resume and shrink the font so it all
fits onto one page i want you to not do
because that also makes you look
i get the feeling of wanting to
show off that you've done so much work
but it doesn't look that great when you
try to squeeze
everything onto one page of a resume it
actually looks
so desperate so what i would say is cut
it down to your
best five or eight roles and put those
under that section and maybe just next
to it right
partial list if you look over at my
i've done more tv shows than what's
listed here i've done more movies than
what's listed here but i don't squeeze
them all
onto my resume just to make it look
i limit it to less than 10 on each
section and then i write
partial list right next to it just so
people understand that there
are more credits i just don't list
everything okay
so that's the same thing that you should
do for the theater section of your
resume in case you have
many many credits moving on the next
section is commercials
can't spell commercials all right so
the most important thing to know here is
industry standard is to only write
available upon
request and that's it this is the only
thing that you write in the commercial
section of a resume
the rule of thumb is to not list your
actual commercial credits on your acting
the reason being if you go into a
commercial audition
let's say it's for burger king and then
you hand them your resume and you did a
mcdonald's commercial
a few years ago and that's on your
resume the person that works at burger
king may look at that
and decide that they don't want to hire
you simply because
you have done a commercial for competing
product even if that commercial isn't on
the air anymore
so this is why you typically just write
conflicts available upon request
on this section now one thing that you
can do is
let's say you have 10 or 15 commercials
instead of writing that you could write
something like 10 plus credits or
if you look over at my resume i write
regional and local 40 plus credits all
so you could write something like that
if you have commercial credits
now one thing that you might do is that
if you are submitting your acting resume
just to get an
agent and you have some commercial
credits maybe at that point is a time
when you do list your credits on your
resume just so they can see
what you've done but when you go to an
actual audition for a commercial
you wouldn't put those on there that
make sense okay moving on
the next section is training
this is the single most important
section of your resume
when you are starting out i've asked my
agent this
on what she looks for when someone
submits to her agency
and she says that if they don't already
have film and television credits
then the first thing that she looks at
is training to make sure that they are
trying to improve themselves
as actors and that they are trying to
stay on top of their craft
and that they are really serious about
making it in this industry so i've said
it in so many other videos and i'm going
to say it again
acting classes are so vital to your
so make sure that you have training that
you can put on your resume
i'm going to copy and paste again so it
doesn't take as much time
to type all right
so the way that you would put training
you would use again the same three
column format here if you have a theater
degree from college you would put
for instance bfa musical theater you put
the name of
or the year that you got it and then the
name of the school where you got your
if you took classes in a in an acting
studio you would put
the name of the class let's say the
meisner technique
the name of the teacher sanford meisner
and the name of the school the
neighborhood playhouse
or if let's say it was on camera class
you would write that name of the teacher
meryl streep
and the yale school of drama i'm pretty
sure meryl streep doesn't actually teach
an on-camera class so don't go looking
for it
okay moving on to the last section which
is called
special skills not just skill skills
there we go
this is something that some productions
will look for
in case they need a character to be able
to perform a certain thing on set
for example let's say that a character
is a college basketball player
well they're going to need that actor to
at least look competent in basketball
and look believable in a college
basketball game
so this is where you would put those
types of skills whether you are skilled
in some sort of sports or
other things one of the most important
ones is
languages so if you were let's say
in spanish you would write that
here and then other skills that you may
i'm going to copy and paste
you might have swing dance experience or
horseback riding or you can drive manual
transmission or you play roller hockey
or soccer baseball football all these
okay so these are all the things that
you can add to your skill section
of a resume and that is pretty much it
look at this resume that we've just
built you don't
have to have all of these sections when
you just start out
when you're just starting out you
probably won't have any television or
film credits right so we're just going
to delete that right now
you might have some web series and
theater you'll have
some training and then you will have
your special skills
if your resume looks like this and it's
not completely
filled in like mine is that's totally
because we all start from somewhere my
resume looked like this when i first
right so this is totally fine i'm gonna
make this example resume available on
google drive i'll put the link down in
the description of this video so that
you can copy and paste
it and create your own personal resume
by following this exact format
all right that was a step-by-step
tutorial on how to create an acting
resume for film and television by the
way if you looked at my acting resume
and you saw all those movies and
television shows and you're wondering
how i auditioned for those
