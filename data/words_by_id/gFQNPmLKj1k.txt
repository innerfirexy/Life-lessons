Right so let's say you want to get started
with this investing thing
You might have a bit of money saved
It's probably not enough for a house
but you reckon I should probably invest this in something
Maybe you've heard on the news about
Tesla or Netflix or Amazon and how
if you'd invested 10 years ago in Tesla
then you'd be a millionaire by now or things like that
But if you're new to the game
this whole investment thing
can seem like a really complicated black box
Like how do you even buy a stock
What even is a stock
Do you just go on tesla.com and buy some Tesla
like how does it work (chuckles)
And if you try and look into this
you get all these acronyms being thrown around
like Roth IRAs and 401Ks in America
or like ISAs or LISAs in the UK
And on top of that there is the anxiety
that we all have that I know investing is risky
and I don't want to lose all that my money
So in light of all of that this is the ultimate guide
on how to get started with investing
It is the video I wish I would have had
five years ago when I first started investing
in stocks and shares
And we're gonna cover this
by thinking about investing in 10 different bite size steps
So the first one is forgetting about investing completely
and just thinking
what happens to my money over time by default
And if you've studied economics
you will know that your money loses its value over time
Thanks to something called inflation (bubble pops)
Inflation is generally around about the 2%-2.5% mark
And so that means that every year stuff costs about 2% more
than it did the year before
For example in 1970 in America
a cup of coffee cost of 25 cents
But in 2019 that same cup of coffee costs a $1 59
That is inflation in action
And so let's say you've got a thousand pounds
in your hand right now
And for the next 10 years
you just stash it under your mattress
And you never look at it again
in 10 years time your thousand pounds
is not gonna be worth a thousand pounds anymore
because everything would have increased
by 2%ish every year
So the value of your money will have fallen
And so if you put your thousand pounds under your mattress
for 10 years you will lose money over time
And this is obviously not good
Even if you put your money in a savings account
like these days
a savings account will give you like 0.2% interest
which means your money goes up by 0.2% every year
But because inflation is up by 2%
you're still losing money over time
And again this is not good
Okay so that begs the question
which is key point number two
which is how do we stop our money
from losing value over time
And the answer is that
if we had a hypothetical savings account
one that was let's say an interest rate of 2.5%
that would match roughly the rate of inflation
So inflation means everything goes up by 2.5%
in terms of price
But our money in our savings account
also goes up by 2.5% each year
Therefore we're technically not losing money over time
If you're watching this and you have an issue
with the word interest don't worry stick to it for now
investment is not the same as interest
but we'll come back to that a bit later
But the point here is that
we don't just want to not lose money
which is what happens at our 2.5% rate
We actually want to make money
And that brings us on to question number three
which is well how do we actually make money
Now let's go back to our hypothetical savings account
If hypothetically we could have a savings account
that was giving us a 10% interest rate
this will never happen because that's just way too high
But hypothetically if it did
that means that every year we'd be making 10%
of the value of the money in our savings account
So for example if I were to put a hundred pounds
in a savings account right now
the next year it would be worth 110
And then the year after it will be 121
because it's 10% of then the 110
and then it would be 130 something
And this would very quickly compound so that
in 10 years time my 100 pounds will have become 259 pounds
And if we adjust for inflation
that our money is still worth 206 pounds in 10 years time
this is pretty good
We have more than doubled our money
by just putting it
in this hypothetical 10% interest savings account
And it really doesn't seem like it would do that
because 10% feels like a small amount of money
But if you extrapolate 10% over 10 years
you actually double your money which is pretty awesome
Sadly these hypothetical 10% saving accounts
don't really exist because it's just way too high
and real life is not that nice
These days most savings accounts in the UK
and I imagine around the rest of the world as well
offer less than a 1% savings rate
which means you're actually still losing money over time
But we do have other options to try
and get us to this magical Nirvana of like you know
this 10% saving thingy
And that is where investments come in
So point number four is what is an investment
And the answer is that an investment
is something that puts money in your pocket
For example let's say you buy a house
for a hundred 1000 pounds
and you want to rent it out to people
There are two ways that's an investment
There are two ways you're making money from it
Firstly let's say you're charging some rent
to the people living in your house
Let's say you're charging them 830 pounds a month
That becomes 10,000 pounds a year
And so every year you're making 10,000 pounds
in rental income which is 10%
of what you originally paid for the house
That means that in 10 years time
you'll have paid off the a 100,000 pounds that you've put in
because you're making 10K a year
And beyond that every year you're just making 10,000 pounds
in pure profit
So that's pretty good
But secondly it's an investment
because the value of the house itself
would probably rise over time
In general there is a trend in most developed countries
that house prices tend to rise over the longterm
And so your house will probably be worth
more than a hundred thousand pounds in 10 years time
And in fact in the UK historically in the past
some people have said that house prices
have doubled every 10 years
So maybe your house is worth close to 200,000 pounds
And so you've made money off of the rental income
but you've also made money off of the capital gains
which is what we call it
when an asset increases in value over time
But the problem is that
buying a house is a little bit annoying
You need to have quite a large amount of money
for a deposit
You need to get a mortgage
You need to actually have the house
You just sought out the rental management
rent it out to people all that kind of stuff
If only there were a way of investing
without a having a large amount of money to start with
and b without having to put that much effort
into managing the assets as well
And that brings us on to investing in shares
And for me basically a hundred percent
of my investment portfolio is entirely shares
I have a tiny percentage in Bitcoin and I own this house
but I don't consider this house an investment
I'll talk about that in a different video
Therefore number five is what are shares
and how do they work
So buying shares probably as close
as we're ever gonna get
to this magical savings account
that just returns some amount of money each year
And the idea is that when you buy a share
you are buying a part ownership
of the company that you've got the share in
For example let's say the Apple
have a particularly profitable year
because lots of people have well iPads
as per my recommendations
and because Apple are feeling kind
they are choosing to pay out a dividend
to their shareholders
So for example they might say that
they're gonna issue a dividend of a million pounds
and that's gonna be split evenly
amongst whoever owns shares in Apple
based on how many shares they own
So for example if you happen to own 1% of Apple
you would get 1% of that dividend that they've issued
So 1% of a million pounds which is 10,000 pounds
obviously no one watching this actually owns 1% of Apple
unless Tim Cook you're watching
I don't even know if you own that much
because that would make you an extremely rich person
because Apple is a very valuable company
but that's basically how the dividend thing works
A company decides to issue a dividend
as a way of returning some of its profit back
to the people who have invested in the company
And therefore you make money through dividends
The second way of making money from shares
is sort of like with houses
in that you get the capital gains over time
So for example let's say you bought 10 shares in Apple
in 2010 at the time those shares were selling for $9 each
So yoU.S.pent $90 on buying 10 shares in Apple
As of October 2020 Apple shares sell for $115
So your 10 shares are now worth $1,150 just by the fact
that you only paid $90 for them 10 years ago
Okay so we've talked about what a share is
and how you make money from them
And at this point you've probably got a few questions
like how much money you need to get started
or how risky is buying shares in a company
And I promise we're gonna get to that
But point number six is how the hell do you buy a share
in the first place
And this is where it can kind of get complicated
because it's not as simple as going on apple.com/buy
and just buying a share in Apple
It doesn't quite work like that
Instead you have to go through what's called a broker
And back in the day a stockbroker was a physical person
usually a dude who you would call on the phone
and say "Hey Bob I want to place an order
for some shares in Apple."
And then Bob would types and stuff into his computer
or a place like a paper order
And then you would own shares in Apple
Thankfully these days we don't really have to talk to Bob
because there's loads and loads of online brokers instead
And so you make an account on an online broker
and then you can buy shares in a company through that
A bit annoyingly every different country
has their own different brokers
that operate in that country
Because to be an online broker in a country
you have to abide by like a zillion different laws
And so in the UK the system is different to the U.S
which is different to Canada and Germany and so on
And the UK for example most banks
do have their own online brokerage type things
So with most bank accounts
you can also open an investment account
with them and then invest online
But usually the interface is a bit clunky
It's a bit old fashioned
And so you're usually better off going
with an online broker
In the UK the two that I use are Charles Stanley Direct
and Vanguard but before we get ahead of ourselves
and make an account on Vanguard or whatever
we need to understand a few more things
And so question number seven is
how the hell do I decide which shares to buy
And the easy answer to that
is that you actually don't want to figure out
which shares to buy
You do not want to buy individual shares
And I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about that
once I've had a haircut so see you shortly
All right
So new hair I've got my Invisalign braces on
So I'm gonna sound a little bit different
but where were we
Oh yeah we were talking about why it's not a good idea
generally speaking to invest in individual stocks
And I'm gonna do a video about this some other time
but essentially the issue with investing
in individual stocks is it's kind of risky
Like yes if you invest in something like Apple
chances are it's gonna be around 10 years from now
But historically there've been quite a few companies
that people were like "Oh my God this is amazing
This is the thing to invest in."
And then that company went bust
So you're automatically exposing yourself to more risk
if you're investing in individual stock
also in general like it's easy to say
hey Amazon grew 10X in the last 10 years
Therefore it's gonna continue to do the same
for the next 10 years
But that's trying to predict the future
And the past is no real indication of future performance
And so the advice
that most people would give for beginners
is that you should not invest in individual stocks
You should invest in index funds
And this is what Graham Stephan
one of my favorite YouTubers also says as well
He says "The index funds are the best safest
and easiest longterm investment strategy for most people."
Which begs the question point number eight
what the hell is an index fund
So there's basically two bits to understand here
there's the index bit and the fund bit
let's start with the fund bit
And a fund is basically where
investors will pool their money
so multiple investors would invest in the same fund
And then that fund would have a fund manager
And the fund manager decides which companies
the fund is gonna invest in
For example let's say I were managing a fund
and I called it Gringotts and let's say a hundred people
from my audience decided to invest in my Gringotts fund
I as the fund manager can say okay the Gringotts fund
now that we have a hundred people's money
let's say it's a 100 million
So everyone's invested 1 million each
I've now got a 100 million
I'm gonna put 20% of that in Apple 10% in Facebook
10% in Amazon 10% in Tesla 10% of Netflix
10% in Johnson and Johnson all of that sort of stuff
And so you the investor don't have to worry about this
because you trust me and my fund Gringotts
to manage your money
And as you know the fund performs well
because the prices of these stocks and shares increases
you get the returns and I take a 1% or 2% management fee
So I make a load of money
because I'm earning 1% or 2% off of this a 100 million
that I'm managing and you're not worrying
about having to pick stocks yourself
You trust me as a seasoned professional to do that for you
So that's what a fund is
Now the index bit refers to a stock market index
And so a stock market index
would for example be the FTSE 100
which is the a hundred biggest companies in the UK
or the S&amp;P 500 which is the 500 biggest companies
in the U.S or the NASDAQ or the Dow
And these are all different indices of the stock market
And if we use the S&amp;P 500 for example
these are the components of the S&amp;P 500
So we said it's the 500 biggest companies in the U.S
So number one is Apple and Apple makes up 6.5% of the S&amp;P
Microsoft makes up 5.5 Amazon makes it 4.7
Facebook has 2.2 Alphabet which is a Google makes 1.5
and 1.5 is about 3% of the total S&amp;P 500
And essentially we've got these 500 companies
if you go all the way down..
Oh Ralph Lauren is 496
but chances are you've not really heard
of many of the other ones at the bottom of the list
but chances are you've heard of most of the companies
towards the top of the list
So the S&amp;P 500 is an index of the U.S stock market
And if you look at the performance
as a whole of the S&amp;P 500 you get a general idea
of how the U.S economy is going as a whole
So this is currently what the S&amp;P 500 looks like
and if we do a five year time horizon
in fact let's go max
So you can see the S&amp;P 500 started in 1980
And since that time
this is what the us stock market has been doing
So as you can see there is a general trend upwards
but for example in 2000 there was a bit of a crash
in 2008 famously there was a bit of a crash
And earlier this year when Corona was first starting
to be a thing there was a bit of a crash
but then the market basically
immediately recovered after that
Okay so we know what a fund is
i.e a way of pooling money
And we know what the index is something like the S&amp;P 500
when you combine those you get an index fund
which is a fund that automatically invests
in all of the companies in the index
And so with me for example
basically all of my investments all of my money
is in the S&amp;P 500 which effectively means
that 6.5% of my investments are in Apple 5.5 in Microsoft
4.7 in Amazon 2.2 in Facebook 3% in Google
1.5 in Berkshire Hathaway and so on
So why is this good
Well it's good for a lot of reasons
So firstly index funds are really really easy to invest in
A big problem that beginners have to investing
it's like well how the hell
do I know which company to invest in
How do I read a balance sheet
How do I do any of this stuff
If you invest in an index fund
you actually don't have to worry about any of that
Secondly index funds give you
a decent amount of diversification
There are all sorts of companies in the S&amp;P 500
So you're not entirely reliant
on the tech sector or the oil sector or the clothing sector
or anything to make the bulk of your money
You are very nicely diversified
across all these U.S companies
Thirdly index funds have very low fees
So because it's not a real person who is deciding
what to invest in and doing all this research
and trying to make loads of money
is essentially a computer algorithm
that automatically allocate your money
based on the components of the index fund
The fees for those are really low
And one of the main things about investing for the longterm
is that even a slight increase in your fees
is gonna massively impact your financial upside
And so for example an index fund with a 0.1% fee
is so much better for you
than an actively managed fund
where a fund manager is charging you even 1%
because the longterm difference between 0.1% fees
and a 1% fee is sort of absolutely astronomical
over the long term
And finally if you look historically
and you know technically historical performance
is not the same thing as future performance
but if you look historically
very few funds have managed
to actually consistently beat the market
i.e outperform the index
And in fact someone like Warren Buffet famously says
that if you gave him a hundred thousand pounds
and asked him to invest it right now
he would just invest in an index fund like the S&amp;P 500
And in fact in 2008 Warren Buffet
challenged the hedge fund industry
to try and beat the market
He said that hedge funds are a bit pointless
because they charge way too high fees
and they don't actually get the sort of returns
they claim to get
And so he set up this 10 year bet
which this company called Protege Partners LLC accepted
where Buffett said that he was gonna bet
that the index fund outperformed the actively managed fund
And he ended up winning that bet
and sort of gave lots of money for charity
or something like that
But that just sort of goes to show that
it's really hard to beat the market
with an actively managed fund
Basically no one can predict
what the market is gonna do in the future
And therefore if you hit your ride on index
i.e you're gambling on the entire market
rather than thinking you know what
I've got some amazing insight
that I'll know exactly which 10 stocks to pick
that are gonna beat the market
You might as well hit your ride with the whole market
rather than individual stocks
Okay so we've sorted out the problem
of which stocks to invest in
by completely circumventing the problem
and instead just investing in index funds
The next big question people usually have
about investing in stocks and shares is the amount of risk
And that brings us to point number nine
And the argument usually goes as follows that
"Hey okay cool
This investing in stocks and shares stuff
It sounds kind of interesting
but my uncle Tom Cobley
invested lots of money in the stock market
And he lost a lot of money
And my parents have told me
that investing in the stock market is a really risky thing
and I shouldn't do it
And I should instead invest in real estate
because real estate is safe."
That is usually the sort of thing
the sort of idea that people have about investing in stocks
And naturally there is the anxiety
of what if I lose all my money
So let's talk about that now
So if we take a step back
the only way to lose money in anything
is if you buy a thing and then you sell it
for less than you actually bought it
Like let's say you bought a house for 300,000 pounds
and then Brexit happens the next day
and the house prices plummet
And now your house is only worth 250,000
At that point if you decide to sell your house
then yes you are losing money
and you've lost 50,000 pounds
Equally the only way to really lose money in stocks
is if you buy a stock at a certain price
and then you sell it for less than that price
So for example let's say you bought shares in Apple
on the 18th of February 2020
And let's say you bought one share
which time was $79 and 75 cents
And because this is your first time in investing
you keep on looking at the price of the Apple stock
because every time are you thinking
oh have I made money have I made money
And really annoyingly for you
you see that over the next kind of few days
a few weeks Apple stock is actually going down
And then on the 18th of March 2020 you decide screw it
I'm gonna sell my one share on Apple
because I don't want to lose all my money
And you sell it for a measly price of $61.67
And so you technically lost $18
because you bought it at $79 in February
and you've sold it for $61 in March
Then you think damn I've lost 20% of my investment
This stock market thing is BS
I'm never gonna invest in the stock market again
and you call it a day
And this would be a very bad thing to do
Because for example if we look at Apple stock price
in March it was $57.31
but if you just held onto your one Apple share
in that time what is it today
It's the 8th of October
Apple is now trading at $114.96
So if you just held on for a few months
you would actually made a lot of money
You would have bought it at $79 and within I don't know
eight months it would now be worth $115
That's a pretty good game
And so the real lesson here is that
when you're investing in stocks and shares
and also when you're investing in real estate
these are longterm investments
Ideally you shouldn't be putting any money
into stocks and shares
that you need to access within the next five years
And actually a lot of people would extend that to 10 years
And it's exactly like that with house prices
it's like if you buy a house as an investment
and then the houses house prices go down
it would be completely stupid of you
to sell the house unless you are absolutely desperate
for the money because something major has happened
And instead if you just held onto the house
then you would have made more money in the long run
because in the longterm house prices always go up
and in the longterm basically
the stock market always goes up
and that's a bit of it can be a controversial statement
It is true but I'm gonna make a video
at some other point explaining why it's true
but for now take my word for it that over the long term
the stock market always goes up
But having said that again this is a longterm thing
And so for example if we look at the S&amp;P 500
and look at how it was in 2008 at the financial crash
right in 2007 it's $1,500 per bit of the S&amp;P 500
And then the crash happens and then by what is it
February 2009 it's down to 735
So basically 50% of the value has been wiped off
of the S&amp;P 500
Now if you bought it in 2007 and you saw it you know
get a crushing and crashing and crashing
and then you sold when it was $800
Now you've lost a lot of money
because you bought high and you sold low
But if you just held on
it took let's see to June 2007 it's at 1500s
it takes about up until 2013
So it takes about five years
for it to get back to its normal level
And even if you'd invested like just before the crash
and then your investment plummeted by 50%
if you would just held on
you'd have bought in at the S&amp;P 500 at 1500
And right now it would be 3,445
So since 2008 2007
when he first invested over the last 13 years
the S&amp;P 500 has more than doubled
So you would have more than doubled your money
provided you did not panic sell when the market crashed
Now hypothetically could the market crashed down to zero
and therefore you will actually lose all your money
Yes it could but if the us stock market
crashed literally to zero i.e all top 500 companies
including Apple Google Microsoft Facebook
like literally every company in the top in the S&amp;P 500
all of those got destroyed overnight
And the stock market crashed to zero
The world would be in some sort of mega apocalypse
and you'd have a lot more serious problems to worry about
rather than the value of your portfolio
of stock market indices on Vanguard
In that scenario in that doomsday scenario
money would stop meaning anything
and you'd be using money to wipe your bum
because money has no value
because the stock market is completely crashed
It's basically unfathomable that the global economy
could be so completely wrecked
such that every single company goes down to zero
In my opinion and again you know
I'm not a financial advisor
This is technically not financial advice
whatever that means but in my opinion
it's unrealistic to think that
if I put my money in stocks and shares
I could lose all of it
There's basically no way you're ever gonna lose all of it
provided you're diversified
If you invested in I don't know
Myspace in 2000 and whatever it was
and then Myspace crushes and then you've lost all your money
because you know they have no money
but if you invest in the top 500 companies in the U.S
or the top 500 companies in the world
or the top 100 companies in the UK
it is so vanishingly unlikely
that you will ever lose your money
That I don't think that is a risk
that we should even be thinking about
So realistic worst case scenario
yes investing in the stock market is risky
in the short term
but if you're investing in the longterm
the market will always go up
and you will always end up making more money in the long run
provided you don't have to take money out
at inopportune times
Okay so at this point we've established that
investing in stocks is very good
and investing in index funds
is a relatively safe way of doing this
The next question is usually when should you get started
Like how old do you have to be
Is it ever too soon to start
Is it ever too late to start
And here the answer is pretty simple
And basically all investment advice
agrees with me on this front
There's a very good website called The Motley Fool
@fool.com and they have a nice article explaining this
Basically you should start investing as soon as possible
It doesn't matter how old you are
It doesn't matter how young you are
The earlier you start investing the better
There are three caveats though
for like sensible financial advice
Firstly you wanna make sure that
all of your high interest i.e credit card debt
is paid off because when it comes to compounding
even though gains compound losses compound as well
And so if you've got like a 6% credit card debt
that's eating into your bottom line every single month
you want to pay that off as soon as possible
Point number two is that
you want to make some sort of emergency fund
And people usually say that your emergency fund should have
in cash basically three to six months of living expenses
so that if you lose your job
or if you're hit with some kind of
incredible medical emergency
and you're not in the UK where medical care is free
or you're in the U.S or something like that
then you've got money to do that
And you don't have to take money out of your investments
And caveat number three is that
you don't want to put any money into stocks
that you think you might need to use
in the next three to five years
So let's say you're 24
and you've just landed your first job
And you're thinking of getting a mortgage
and buying a house and you need money for the deposit
Do not put that money into the S&amp;P 500
or into any kind of stocks and shares
because no one can time the market
And no one knows whether we might
you know there might be a market crash tomorrow
All we know is that in the longterm
the stock market goes up
but if you need to buy a house next year
there is absolutely no guarantee
that that money will still be worth exactly the same
or worth more this time next year
So it provided those two conditions are met
Like firstly you have no high interest credit card debt
And secondly you've already got your emergency fund
And thirdly you're not planning to gonna have
a major expense in the next few years
At that point absolutely everyone
should be investing something into the stock market
In my opinion whether you're 12 or 20 or 21 or 22 or 50
it doesn't matter
And as they say on the market floor
there is almost no way your future self
will regret making the decision to invest
And as you know at this point
this is because of compounding
The more time you leave your money in the stock market
the more it compounds
And there is a huge difference
There's like lots of interesting numbers
about this on the internet that people have calculated
that if you start investing at the age of 20
versus if you start investing at the age of 25 or 30
it makes such a huge difference to your bottom line
That basically as soon as you watch this video
and hear about investing you should start investing
provided those three conditions
that we talked about are met
All right so we're nearly there
Now we're point 11 out of 12 where we said
okay you sold me on this idea of investing in index funds
All of these three conditions are met
I don't have a high interest credit card debt
I've got my emergency fund or I'm a student
And therefore my parents are my emergency fund
and I'm not planning to buy a house
or a big thing in the next three years
The next question is usually
how much money do I need to get started with investing
And I know a lot of students watch my channel
and I had a lot of comments on Instagram saying
"I'm 14 years old and I don't have any money
How do I get started with investing?"
And the answer here is again quite easy
basically start with whatever you can
For some of these websites and some of these apps
that you can use to invest in stock market indices
You can start with as little as $5 or 10 pounds
depending on the website
You might need to start with a 100 pounds or a 1000 pounds
You can research this
and it kind of depends on which country you're in
but basically you want to start investing
as soon as possible
And it doesn't matter
if it's a tiny amount of money to begin with
Firstly it's useful to invest small amounts of money
because compounding is always good
But secondly and more importantly
the sooner you start investing
the sooner it becomes a habit
And so for me for example I started investing in 2015
I knew absolutely nothing about it before then
but I really wish I'd started investing in like 2009
when I first had my first part time job
because a that would have encouraged
good financial habits within me
I would have kept aside maybe 10% or 20%
from the top line to put into my investments
Secondly it would have meant that investing became a habit
And so I would have known about the fact
that stock market indices exist
I would have done the research
I would have watched videos like this
although these weren't really a thing in 2009
And what I'm really annoyed about with myself
is I started making actual money in like 2012
when my first business started to do very well
And between 2012 and 2015 I did not invest any money
just because I didn't know that you could
And I didn't know how
and I always kinda thought that
"Huh I'm making money now."
It's just sort of sitting in my bank account
And I know that inflation is a thing
So I know my money's losing value
but I just didn't think about investing
and didn't realize how easy it is and that it's a thing
And so I really wish I'd started investing
my real money in 2012
but the only way I would've done that is
if I had started investing from 2009
when I first started making I don't know
six pounds an hour during my part time job
So again and I can't state this emphatically enough
Like it doesn't matter
if all you have is a small amount to invest
even if it's one pound even if it's 10 P
The process of making the account
and researching online stockbrokers in your country
and figuring out how to actually do this stuff
is like the most valuable thing
that you could be doing with your time
immediately after watching this video
And finally point number 12 is okay
I'm sold I've got a 100 pounds here
and I want to put it inside a stock market index fund
How do I actually do that
And the answer here is you want to find an online broker
So this will vary massively
depending on which country you're in
because these online brokers as I said
have like zillions of laws they have to comply with
and financial regulations and all this stuff
In the U.S most people that I know
use the Vanguard as well
And my favorite blogger Mr Money Mustache
recommends that as well
Although in the U.S
there are also other services like Betterment
which I'd bet a few friends who use that as well
Again depending on which country you're in
like literally all you have to do is Google the phrase
best online broker Germany
or best online broker Pakistan
or best online broker India whichever country you're in
And you'll find something read some reviews
Basically the thing you're looking for
is you want to be able to invest in index funds
and you want the fees to be as low as possible
I think Charles Stanley Direct the fee is 0.25%
which was the lowest at the time when I made my account
and I think is still pretty competitive
So you want the fee to be like a really really really
small fraction of a percentage
Then once you've made your account
and verified your identity
and gone through all the hoops and stuff
which sometimes takes a few days
and they send you a letter to the post
to verify your address
like depending on what the regulations are
Once you've done that
then you can start just putting money in here and there
And all the friends that I've spoken to about this stuff
over the last like four years
since I first started knowing about investing in things
they've all started making accounts
and sort of making these investment counts for themselves
For the first few weeks they all sort of
compulsively check their phones
to see what the stock market is doing
But then very quickly you realize
that actually I'm investing for the long term here
I actually don't give a toss
what the stock market is doing in the short term
I check my portfolio once every six months
just cause sometimes I'm curious
I don't even bother looking at it
This is very much a set it and forget it strategy
you're investing for the longterm
Your money will magically grow over time
provided you don't touch it and think
"Oh crap the stock market's going down a bit
I'm gonna take my money
because I can't handle these losses."
There's loads more to say about investing in finance
but hopefully this was a reasonably concise
not very concise
This is gonna be a long video but well
hopefully this was a reasonable introduction
to how to get started with investing in index funds
If you have more questions about exactly what to do
or anything else about money
Do leave a comment in the video description area thing
I'm still trying to think of a name for this series
I was thinking I posted on Instagram
There were a few options: Money talks
was quite a popular one but that's already a film
One that I really liked was Penny Sitting
I think I might call this series Penny Sitting
that was kind of cool
A lot of people said like financeshially financially
'cause my name's Alica financially
a few different options
I mean the way you think
if you have any ideas for what this entire series
about money and stuff should be called..
And final piece of advice if you're in the UK
if you're in the UK
and you're just getting start with investing
basically go on Hargreaves Lansdown
and make a Lifetime ISA
A Lifetime ISA is a very good deal
You can read more about it at moneysavingexpert.com
within the Lifetime ISA as of 2020
you can put up to 4,000 pounds a year into it
And then you can invest that in the S&amp;P 500
which is what I would do
If you have more than 4,000 pounds a year to invest
you can then put another 16,000 into a stocks and shares ISA
which I'd recommend doing on a vanguardinvestor.co.uk
And if you have more than 20,000 pounds to invest in a year
and you're doing really well
then just open a general investment account with Vanguard
This is what I do I think it works great
Loads more links in the video description
