hey guys so in this video we are going
over the step-by-step process of buying
your first rental or investment property
this video will be aimed specifically at
beginners but i think anyone will find
it useful we'll talk about how to
prepare for buying your first home
getting pre-approved for a residential
actually finding and then closing on a
property as well as of course how to
make money from real estate investing
just some quick background about myself
my name is charlie and i am a real
estate broker living in southern
california i have my own investment
property and i've also been brokering
loans since 2013 so hopefully that gives
you guys a reason to listen to what i'm
saying there are tons of ways to invest
in real estate for example reits which
stands for real estate investment trusts
fix and flips
long-term rentals buying multi-units and
a lot more in this video we are focusing
long-term residential rentals as well as
buying multi-unit properties
to rent out i think this is the goal
that most people have they want to
in multi-unit rentals and of course
there is a good reason many people make
a lot of money with these types
of investment properties so here are
some of the ways of making money
while investing in real estate the first
one is appreciation and this is when the
value of the house
goes up now in many parts of the country
we've seen prices skyrocket in the last
few decades and as a result
some people have made a ton of money for
example in palo alto where i was raised
home prices used to be like three four
hundred five hundred thousand dollars
now they are easily
two to three to four million dollars now
of course not every area is going to
have that
high rate of appreciation then very
likely you will see appreciation the
is paying towards the principle of the
loan when you have a mortgage and you're
making your monthly payment
part of that money goes to principal aka
your equity and part of that goes to
interest now whatever money you're
putting into the principal the equity
that's like a for
savings account you're increasing the
percent of the home that you actually
own and therefore at some point when you
sell the house you're gonna get that
money back see i do refer to this as a
liquid savings account alright the third
way you make money through real estate
investing is through rental income and
the best case scenario is when you have
positive cash flow this means that all
your rental income is higher than your
mortgage your property taxes and any
other fees you're paying to maintain the
besides the money part there are tons of
other pros to real estate investing as
for example you get tax advantages and
you get diversification
millionaires say that real estate is the
best way to invest money for a reason
it's made a lot of people very rich and
it allows people to leverage money at
extremely low interest
rates aka your mortgage and control
something that normally you would not be
able to control
in this case a house that's worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars now a
lot of people also think that to
invest in real estate they need to buy a
gigantic like 15 unit apartment complex
nope that is definitely not the case you
can start very small with real estate
investing even buying your own home
i consider that investing in real estate
that's why it's so exciting and it's a
type of investing that grows with you
you can start small with your own home
or small investment property and then
work your way up to larger and larger
units now let's talk about all the steps
that are required in order to get your
first property it's not as simple as you
know just going out there and buying
your property there's a lot of prep
and you have to build up your finances
in order to safely buy a home
without going broke okay step one is
your credit score and i have this first
this is something that you can start at
any age like yes even if you're 15 years
old you can start working on your credit
right now your credit score sort of
defines your finances for the rest of
your life so that's why it's so
important for example it determines who
trusts to lend you money and how much
money they're willing to lend you it
determines your interest rates it
getting approved for loans now is it
always fair like this credit score
not always but it is a system that if
you know how it works
you can definitely have a top tier
credit score without too much effort so
the fico score is what
lenders look at when they determine if
you're eligible or not for a loan your
fico score is made up of payment history
at 35
credit utilization at 30 length of
credit history at 15
mix of credit types at 10 and the number
of recent applications at 10
as well this is important because as you
can see payment history is
extremely important you don't want to
miss any payments or have anything go
into default now when you're trying to
buy a house i always tell people
the optimal score you should be looking
for is a 740 or above
i believe the average credit score in
the us is 703 which is not too bad and
that will get you a favorable interest
rate when you do apply
for a loan however 740 plus is optimal
that's gonna get you the best rate and
that is considered an exceptional credit
score i've made other videos about this
in more detail but when you have a
really high credit score
the interest rate you get is
significantly lower and in the long term
that's gonna save you thousands and
thousands of dollars what i recommend is
if you're young get your first credit
card and start using credit cards
instead of debit cards debit cards are
good if you are scared of spending too
much money but if you want to build your
credit and you want to build it the easy
and fast way
make sure you get a credit card and use
it wisely if you're too young to have
your own credit card or your credit just
isn't high enough to actually get
for a credit card of your own what you
can do is become an authorized user
on one of your parents cards now you
have to make sure that your parent has
good credit of course because you're
essentially sharing that credit card
with them and any payments done on that
goes towards building your own credit my
parents did that for me and by the time
i was ready to open up my own credit
luckily i had a good enough score to do
so so yeah start young and set yourself
up for success there are so many
advantages of having a high credit score
and you will thank me later
number two is just to be in the game and
what i mean by this is
know what real estate investing entails
and know how to do it the first thing i
recommend is having a lot of knowledge
in real estate investing and to do that
there are things like podcasts
books youtube you can pay for mentorship
there's tons of things you can do to
learn about real estate investing you'll
want to understand the financials of
real estate investing for example how
making money in real estate works
cash flow calculating profit there are
so many things that you guys can learn
about this
you can also follow people who do real
estate investing as a living see their
instagram stories
see their behind the scenes and just see
how what they do on a day-to-day basis
and have a vision have a goal
set in mind that you want to achieve for
real estate investing whether that's
just owning a few small properties in
your local area or owning properties
across the country
set that vision and let that inspire you
this is the prep stage of real estate
investing you need to have a good
foundation of what real estate investing
means and so if you are young if you are
not yet ready to buy a house
this is the step where you should just
be preparing learning as much as you can
all right the third step to getting your
first real estate investment property
is employment and sadly you cannot buy a
house without a job i mean it sort of
makes sense but
that's just the reality of it and by job
i mean like a real job you can't just
you know
sell things on craigslist for fun it
needs to be stable and it has to be
documented as well this means you'll
need tax records you'll need w-2s
just anything that shows your income is
stable and it's not just the one time
thing from a lender's viewpoint they're
can this person afford to make these
payments for the next 30 years the last
thing they want is for you to not be
able to make your payments and for them
to foreclose on the house that's a lot
of effort on their part and they just
don't want to do that so yeah any cash
you make on the side that actually
doesn't count as income
in the lender's viewpoint it has to be
taxed income income that shows up
on your tax return now this is where
people that have a traditional nine to
five job anything that has a w-2
have a huge advantage it's very hard for
entrepreneurs or
self-employed people to actually qualify
for a house unless of course you are
a really established entrepreneur now
what i would say is if you are in this
type of situation where it might be
hard to prove your income one thing you
can do is try and find a co-signer and
this is probably going to be a parent or
who has a stable income and can help you
get approved for that loan of course you
still have to be able to make those
payments you need to
really trust that person and they really
have to trust you as well because if you
don't make those payments
then they're on the hook and their
credit is going to be screwed the thing
you have to look out for
with your employment is look at your
debt to income ratio
this is all your monthly payments
divided by your pre-tax
income and this number has to be under
40 to 45
it really depends on the lender so take
your pre-tax monthly income
multiply that by let's say 0.4 and that
should be the max amount of money you
spend on a house on your mortgage
on your cars on student loans all that
stuff added up together that is why
increasing your income is so important
for real estate investing especially if
you're trying to buy bigger and bigger
and bigger properties all right the
fourth step is to
hire a real estate agent in the area
that you are looking at now when you're
hiring an agent you're not going to rely
on them completely they are your guide
to the area and they should be an expert
but also if you want to really do this
long term
you need to be an expert as well ask
your agent which locations which pockets
of neighborhoods are going to do well
for the next 10 years
really try and get their insight about
the location as a whole and i also
recommend that you do your own research
on this
go to city data.com and from there you
can look at the statistics of any city
you put in there you can look at past
you can look at the crime data you can
look at the population changes you can
look at the school data it's all really
important when trying to come up with a
city that you want to invest in because
like i mentioned earlier
that first part of making money with
real estate was appreciation and if you
have appreciation on your side then
you're going to make a lot more money on
this property
ask your real estate agent to send you
deals whenever they pop up a lot of
these deals they are
snatched up very fast and that's why you
want someone to always be on the lookout
for you and send you deals when they pop
up just keep looking keep looking and
you know sometimes it takes people
hundreds of homes before they actually
find one house that makes sense and that
they actually invested but with all this
training and practice
you will learn how to spot deals and
you'll know how to run numbers that tell
you whether or not a deal is good all
right the fifth step
is to find the lender and get a
pre-approval now i think about this
maybe this step
should actually be before finding a real
estate agent and starting to look at
homes actually yes you definitely need
to talk to a lender before you start
looking for homes this is the boring
part that no one actually cares about
but it's one of the most important parts
and the reason why it's so important is
because they're going to tell you how
much house
you can afford based on your income
based on the property type based on the
interest rates down payment and all
these other factors
all these things come together and they
determine what price range you should be
looking at and yeah you don't want to
waste your time you don't want to waste
your real estate agent's time and yeah
so just know exactly how much you will
be able to qualify for before you start
looking at homes now one thing i want to
say is when you are investing in
investment properties and multi-unit
properties the lender will actually use
50 of the projected rental income as
your own future income that way for
example you can afford a multi-unit
property with a bigger price tag
than you would be able to afford a
smaller property that is only a single
family residence so that's why it's
important to talk to a lender they're
going to say what type of property
you're looking at and if it is a
multi-unit property then yeah you can
afford a more expensive home than if you
were to
just buy a condo or a single family
house the other thing that you will talk
about with the lender is
what loan program is right for you now i
think most of you guys are going to go
with an fha or a conventional loan
generally an
fha loan is better for people with a
lower credit score they are definitely
more forgiving in the area but the good
part about conventional loan is that
there are fewer fees a lot of people
also think that the only way you can put
down a super low down payment is through
an fha loan but that isn't the case
you can actually put three percent down
with a conventional loan but no you will
be paying
private mortgage insurance all right so
now that we have the mortgage stuff out
of the way
now this is the step where you actually
get an offer accepted and
close on your property this is step
number six but actually this step is
like a hundred different steps combined
you have to make offers you have to
negotiate you have to work on repairs
this might take months or maybe even
years to get an accepted offer depending
on your bidding strategy i've heard
people viewing maybe 10 homes 20 homes
even up to 100 homes before they get an
offer accepted the shorts that i
personally have seen
is seven days on investment property but
also i have clients who have been
looking for months and months without
finding anything it really is a complex
process that your agent will take
you through and can really help you with
those negotiations the repairs
and the whole escrow process once you do
get an offer accepted
it's generally 30 days of escrow and
trust me there are going to be things
that come up during escrow that make you
super annoyed but that is just the whole
home buying process one thing i want to
say is always do a home inspection i've
never seen the client
lose money from doing a home inspection
now a home inspection generally costs
let's say 400 500 but now with that
inspection report in your hands
you have a lot of leverage to ask for
money from the seller you can ask them
for credits or you can have them
actually repair things
that need to be repaired before escort
closes all right the seventh and final
step is to
get the investment property rented out
now if you're buying a property for
yourself then
obviously that's good you just get to
live there but if you're buying a
multi-unit living one of the units and
renting the other ones out or you're
just buying a property and leasing it
out to tenants
you will have to go through the process
of finding tenants screening them
and renting the unit out there are
different ways you can do this and
probably the easiest way is just to hire
a property manager they'll usually
charge you one month's rent and then
they'll charge between five to ten
of the rental income as their management
fee or you know you can do it yourself
if the house is near you then maybe you
want to take on that by yourself and
just learn from the process the two most
important things are knowing the market
rent and you can do this by looking on
looking on hot pads and seeing what
comparable properties are renting for
and also the tent screening process you
really want to make sure that your
tenant is stable
is going to make the payments and is not
going to give you a hard time so
congratulations you guys watch this
video and you are one step ahead
of most people most people never get
into real estate investing because as
you just saw there are just so many
steps and there's so much effort to get
into your first investment property
there's so much to learn and this is a
multi-step process
it can take months or even years
therefore there are so many points where
you can just be like
all right i don't want to do this and
decide to stop so that's why i want to
tell you guys
just take action if you're young get
started right now start preparing and
really get that knowledge
of real estate investing into your head
it really is a complicated process
so i encourage you guys to refer back to
this video or even more detailed videos
as you are in the process there's no way
that you can remember all this
and just remember to implement it on
your first try you definitely will need
some handholding but that is
totally okay you know every real estate
investor starts out like that and it
really is a great time to invest in real
estate you know we have all these
powerful resources free education
available online where yeah you can
probably get
all the information you need to invest
in real estate straight here on youtube
another really great resource that you
guys should check out
is bigger pockets they have a website
with a forum and a podcast
and really helpful articles that will
for sure make this whole process a lot
easier and if you guys are really
serious about investing in real estate
long term then it might make sense to
get your own real estate license that's
exactly what i did
i knew that i wanted to get into real
estate you know for the long term so i
went ahead
and got my license from real estate
express so i went ahead and just took my
online course
and got my real estate license it's
gonna help you out a ton just based on
the amount of information you learn
and saving on the commission especially
if you're doing a ton and a ton of deals
that commission
is really going to add up just note that
when you're representing yourself at the
very start of your real estate career
you might not save money compared to
hiring an experienced agent so yeah just
keep that in mind but hey you guys i
will leave a link to the course i took
below in my opinion it's probably the
and cheapest course available online and
every person that ends up taking this
really enjoys it so yeah thank you guys
