how much does an agent cost i think
there's some confusion regarding this
question because the truth is an agent
actually doesn't charge you
anything to start working with you i'm
gonna explain exactly how all of that
works in this video
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television
industry my name is kurt yu thank you so
much for spending some time here with me
if it's your first time here make sure
to subscribe to this channel to get more
videos on acting auditioning and career
every single week today we're talking
about talent agents
specifically how much an agent costs
this is a follow-up video to a video i
made a few months ago about
four ways to get a talent agent if
you're interested in that video i'll put
a link to it
down in the description below but i
noticed in the comments of that previous
video that a lot of people were saying
they don't want to get an agent because
they're afraid they're going to be too
expensive well that's
definitely a misconception because
agents actually don't charge you any
money up front to start working with you
that's not how an agent works but you
may need to spend some money on some
other things in order for the agent to
start working for you
effectively i'm going to explain exactly
what that means and how all that works
in this video
but before we get started i just want to
quickly say to those people who are
brand new to this channel if this is
your first time here first of all
second of all if you're interested in
learning how i approach
my auditions then i've actually created
a free 10-step audition preparation
guide that i call my audition cheat
sheet if you're interested in
downloading that cheat sheet you can get
it by going to that link right up there
it's actually the audition preparation
process that i have used in the past
that has helped me book
dozens of movies and television shows so
again if you want to download that you
can go to that link and get it for free
all right so today we're talking about
how much an
agent costs and the misconception that
an agent is expensive
like i said before an agent doesn't
charge you any money up front
in order to start working with you if
someone tells you that they're a talent
and they want you to pay them five
hundred dollars before they can sign you
they are an absolute scam they are not a
real agent
a real agent doesn't charge you any
money to start working with you
the way an agent actually gets paid is
through a commission
meaning they make a 10 to 20 commission
off of the money that you make through
your acting
so for example let's say you start
working with an agent
first of all you don't pay them any
money in the beginning but
if you book an acting job and you make
let's say a hundred dollars
and the agent takes a 10 commission that
means the agent gets
dollars of that hundred dollars and you
get ninety dollars
so that's how an agent makes money they
take a commission
off of your paycheck this is great
because you never have to worry about
not having enough money to pay your
agent because the only time you pay your
is when you get paid so if you make a
hundred dollars you give them 10 you
keep 90. if you make a thousand dollars
you give them a hundred you keep 900.
that's how it all works now depending on
the type of job that's where you might
see some differences in terms of it
might be a 10
or a 15 or a 20 commission we won't get
into the details of all of that in this
video but the point is that
the only time you pay your agent is
through a commission
you never have to pay them a flat fee
every month just to be working with them
so i hope all that makes sense in terms
of how an agent gets paid
now i want to talk about where you may
need to be spending some money elsewhere
in order to work with an agent
effectively remember that
when you start working with an agent
you're basically telling the world that
you are now
a professional actor you're not doing
this for fun anymore you're not doing
this as a hobby anymore
you want to be seen as a professional
actor and in order to be a professional
then you may need some professional
in this case for an actor you may need a
professional headshot an agent may ask
to get a professional headshot you may
also need to sign up for certain casting
websites that may cost some money in
terms of a subscription fee or it may
cost some money in order to upload
photos or
upload videos those are some of the the
costs involved
in working with an agent that doesn't go
the money doesn't go directly to them
but you may need to spend some money in
for the agent to work with you
effectively because think about it if
someone says they are a professional at
then there are going to be some
expectations for example
if i want to hire a professional
then i expect them to have a
professional camera
i don't expect them to come and take
photos with just their phone right
so same thing with an actor once you say
that you want to be a professional
actor then agents and casting directors
and producers and everybody else in this
they're going to expect you to have some
of the professional tools
for for example a professional headshot
professional resume
uh your online casting profiles filled
out and all of those things
so understand that those are some costs
that you may have to incur
in order to work with an agent so i hope
that clears things up as to how much an
agent actually costs
and where you may or may not need to be
spending your money
