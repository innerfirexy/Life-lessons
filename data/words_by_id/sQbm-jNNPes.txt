back in 2011 three years after i started
taking acting classes i booked my first
speaking role in a major movie the movie
was called won't back down and it
three a-list actors maggie gyllenhaal
viola davis and oscar isaac
now during the audition process for this
movie i learned
one huge lesson about auditioning that
has continued to help me to this very
so in this video i want to share with
you how i auditioned for
and booked my role as well as the big
lesson that i learned
that will hopefully help you in your
career as well
what's up my fellow actors welcome to
the acting career center here to help
you learn the skills you need to break
into the film and television industry
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for
spending some time here with me today
if this is your first time here make
sure to subscribe to this channel to get
more videos on
acting auditioning and career advice
every single week
now a lot of people want to know how to
audition for a movie especially
big hollywood movies so today i want to
share with you the story
of how i booked my first hollywood movie
as well as the big lesson that i learned
from that audition
experience the first thing that i want
to explain is what i mean by
hollywood movie just because a movie is
produced by
a studio that is based in hollywood that
doesn't necessarily mean that that movie
filmed in hollywood the best example of
this is the
highest grossing movie of all time
avengers endgame
now i think everyone would agree that
avengers endgame is a
major blockbuster hollywood movie but
guess what
avengers endgame was not filmed in
hollywood the majority of the movie was
filmed in atlanta
georgia that's the case for many many
movies that are quote unquote hollywood
they are filmed in other states and
sometimes other countries
and that's what happened with my first
movie role in won't bat down
that movie had three major hollywood
actors and it was distributed by 20th
century fox
and yet that movie was not filmed in
hollywood it was filmed in pittsburgh
pennsylvania which is what eventually
gave me the opportunity to audition for
it because at the time
i was living in cleveland ohio and i had
an agent
in cleveland that had an office in
pittsburgh and they were able to submit
me to the casting director donna
belichick who is a local pittsburgh
casting director
so here's how the audition process went
for that movie pittsburgh is about
two hours away from cleveland and at the
time there were no
self-taped auditions so when i got the
first email about that audition from my
agent i grabbed my headshot and resume
and i drove
two hours to pittsburgh i did my
audition for donna belijak in her office
and then i drove two hours back home to
and then three weeks went by i didn't
hear anything
until i got another email from my agent
that said hey you have another audition
for a different role for that movie
so i grabbed my headshot and resume i
drove two
hours to pittsburgh i did my audition
for donna and i drove two hours back
home to cleveland
a week after that i was notified that i
got a call back for that
audition so i grabbed my headshot and
i drove two hours to pittsburgh i did my
call back
this time with the director in the room
and then i drove two hours back home to
three more weeks go by i didn't hear
anything and at this point
i have learned that production has
already started on the movie meaning
they've already started
filming the movie typically when
production starts they have already cast
all the roles and in this case they did
so in my mind i'm thinking darn i did
not book them which was true i did not
book either of those roles that i
auditioned for
and then one day i get a call from my
and he tells me hey they actually want
to book you for a role in the movie it
none of the roles that you audition for
but you got to go to pittsburgh in a
couple days they'll put you in a hotel
and then you will film on set
the next day i was super happy i had no
idea what had happened
but i just booked my very first speaking
role in a movie so i was
really excited so how did i book that
role without ever auditioning for it
well here's what happened after the
movie started production the director
who also happened to be the writer his
name was daniel barnes
he decided that in one of the scenes the
main character who was played by maggie
needed something else to happen to her
to help tell the story
and because of that they needed another
character now instead of going through
another round of auditions
they decided to just choose from the
pool of actors
who had already auditioned for the other
roles in the movie
and they decided to choose me and that
is how i
booked my very first speaking role in a
major movie
i'm actually extremely grateful that i
had to jump through all of those hoops
before i booked my role
i'm really happy that i had to drive
back and forth from cleveland pittsburgh
three times
not book either of those roles and then
eventually get offered a completely
different role
because that process helped teach me
this big lesson that has helped me
throughout my entire career
and that is this as actors our job when
we go to an audition
is not to book the role our job is to
the room now if you have never heard the
term book the room before i'll explain
it in a second first let me explain
why our job is not to book the role and
that's because there are so many factors
that go into the casting process
that we as actors have zero control over
we could actually go to an audition and
give the
best performance in the history of the
world and they'll still
offer the part to somebody else why
maybe we were just wrong for the part
maybe we were too tall for the role or
short for the role or too young or too
old or too
many many other things that could go
into this
casting process so if we don't have
over this how can that be our job so our
job needs to be something that we
actually have control over
and that is booking the room let me
explain what that means
whenever you go into an audition by the
time you walk
out that door you need to leave the
people in there thinking
wow that was a professional actor and if
you walk out the door and you left them
wow that was a professional actor then
you have done your job
and you have booked the room because if
they are thinking that of you
then that means in the future they are
more likely to call you in for more
auditions whether that's a casting
director whether that's a director or
you will get more auditions from them
and that
is your job as an actor because we can
actually control
how we present ourselves in the audition
room we can't control whether or not we
book the part
but we can control how we come off as a
professional actor
in the room in front of the casting
director there's an acting teacher here
in atlanta who's a friend of mine his
name is alex collins and he talks about
controlling your controllables which are
the three things that he says actors
complete control over in our careers and
those are
your materials your attitude and
your training let's talk about how those
three things can help you
book the room in an audition your
refers to your professional headshot
your professional resume
and your online casting profiles like
actors access and casting networks
if those things are filled out correctly
and you have a professional headshot and
then that can help you book the room at
an audition you have control over all
your attitude if you present yourself in
a professional manner
if you treat everyone you meet with with
you have control over that and that can
help you book the room
and finally your training have you been
taking acting classes
have you been doing everything that you
can to improve your craft
have you been doing everything that you
can to make yourself the best actor you
can be
you have control over that and if you
have been doing that
and you've been able to apply your
training to this audition
and you've prepared for this audition to
the best of your ability
and then you go into the room and you
deliver the best audition you possibly
then that can help you book the room and
speaking about preparing for auditions
if you're interested in learning about
how i prepare for my auditions
then i've created a free audition cheat
sheet with the
10 steps that i use to help prepare the
best audition that i can
and if you want to download that free
cheat sheet you can do it by clicking
that link right there
or by clicking the link down in the
description so let's go back to my
audition for the movie won't back down
i have zero doubt that this is what
helped me get the role that i eventually
because when i got my first audition i
drove to pittsburgh i did my audition
and i went home
i didn't end up booking that role but i
booked the room
so three weeks later they brought me
back to audition for another role
i did it and i went back to cleveland i
got a call back for that role
so i drove back to pittsburgh i did the
call back
and i went back to cleveland i didn't
end up booking that role
either but i booked the room again so
when it came time for them to cast
this new role that was written into the
movie i have no doubt that those three
auditions that i did
helped give them confidence that i was
the right person for the part
so that's my story about how i got my
first speaking role in a major movie as
well as the big lesson that i learned
about booking the room
that has helped me to this very day
