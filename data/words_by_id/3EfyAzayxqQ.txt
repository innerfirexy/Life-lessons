do you need to be good-looking be an actor
yes thanks for watching what come on
look if you really believe that you must be good looking to become a successful
actor
well Steve Buscemi would like to have a word with you
kurt from small-market actor dot com okay let's be real about this
good-looking people do get more opportunities in this
industry that is no secret but that doesn't mean you need to look like the
love child of
Ryan Gosling and Megan Fox to make money as an actor
the fact is that there are roles out there for absolutely
everyone you just need to know what it is that you
fit for instance I know I look nothing like Brad Pitt
and aside from massive amounts of plastic surgery I realized there's nothing I can
do to change that
now am I gonna sit here and wallow in self pity because I don't look like a
Hollywood megastar
no I'm gonna focus on finding the title roles that fit my look
because there's plenty of them out there but that doesn't mean that I can
completely ignore my physical appearance either
if I totally let myself go and start looking like jabba the hutt
my number of opportunities are going to shrink dramatically
so my point is while you shouldn't be comparing yourself to
a-list movie stars you should however still make concerted effort to look
your very best presentation is key in this industry
so it's very important to look healthy be well groomed
and wear clothes that fit well and are flattering and make you look good
if you can simply do those things and couple that with and knock out
audition I guarantee you'll stand out much more than the person with
supermodel good looks but has a mediocre audition
on that note I also want to mention that there is such a thing
as too good-looking now you me think that that's crazy but I can't even tell you
how many
audition notices that I've personally seen written on them in big bold
font no model types we prefer
everyday looking people and if you think about it
that makes sense because companies are trying to connect with their audiences
through their commercials so more MORE they're hiring actors who looked like
regular people because that's who the general public will identify with
so not looking like a supermodel can have its advantages as well
you know there was once a young girl who almost didn't pursue acting because
she thought she was too ugly her name was Meryl Streep
now I probably don't have to tell you that she is now widely recognized as
the very best of her generation so while
looks do matter in this industry they don't matter as much as you might think
stop worrying about your looks and start focusing
on mastering your craft because that will carry you
farther than supermodels looks ever will
