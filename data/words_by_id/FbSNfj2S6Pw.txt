- All right
so the truth about productivity
is that it's not really about the apps
it's not really about having a perfect system
or about being disciplined
or motivated more than anyone else
Those things do help
but what I've realized over the last few months
is that there is actually a hidden secret
to productivity and fulfillment
So grab a cup of tea and we can talk about it
As you may or may not know
I am in the middle of writing a book
and it's a book about productivity
And so I've been thinking a lot over the last few months
about like what does productivity actually mean to me
And the main insight that I've realized
is that productivity to be honest
isn't really about getting more things done
it's mostly about learning joy the journey
because when we're having fun
we're doing the things that we're doing
then productivity kind of just takes care of itself
And this is kind of obvious right
Like you know when we're doing stuff that we enjoy
when we're hanging out with friends or watching Netflix
or playing video games
we're never worried about our productivity
we're never worried about motivation
We never say
I need to be motivated to watch this next episode
of Netflix or to play "War Zone" with the boys
We only really need motivation
in inverted commas for the things
that are like short-term painful for long-term gain
And we as humans we are absolutely terrible
at motivating ourselves to do things
in service to our future selves
because we're all obsessed with instant gratification
And so the conundrum that we're dealing with
is how do we make ourselves do things
that are short-term painful in service to our future selves
How do we make ourselves
How do we motivate ourselves to be productive
to sit down and learn to code
or to do our homework assignment
or to work on that side project
after we've come home from a hard day of work
because we know we wanna be entrepreneurs
at the end of the day
And there's broadly two ways of answering this question:
The first one is something that I call
the Muhammad Ali method
This is called the Muhammad Ali method
because Muhammad Ali famous boxer
has this famous quote where he said something like
"I hated every minute of training
"but I said don't quit
"Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion."
And my middle is amazing
everyone loves him and all that stuff obviously
But I think this approach
to work as like work equals suffering
that's an approach that I'm not really a fan of
and maybe that's what you need
if you wanna become like you know
world heavyweight boxing champion
or if you wanna win gold at the Olympics
But you know if I think about what I want from my life
it's not to be the best in the world at anything
it's not to win a gold medal
or a Nobel prize or to be a boxing champion
the thing that I want from my life
which I think is true for a lot of us
is that I wanna live a nice balanced life
where I'm having fun
working on things that I enjoy
doing things that contribute a bit to the world
and not really being overly concerned
with like trying to be the best
or trying to compete with other people
And so I think the problem
with this Muhammad Ali approach to life
i.e this work equals suffering approach to life
is that it kind of glorifies the hustle
and glorifies the grind that you need to suffer
this needs to be painful and if it's painful
it's because you're doing it right
and if you're not doing it
it's because you can't stand the pain
And obviously that's a huge oversimplification
and I'm sure his stance on this is actually more nuanced
But when I think of like my own life over the last 15 years
and how I do things like YouTube channel entrepreneurship
medical school being a doctor podcast
all this stuff that people messaged me about
none of it feels like suffering
None of it feels like a grind
None of it feels like work
None if it feels like a hustle
And so one of my housemates says
"It's 11 o'clock at night
"like why are you still working?"
It's always a bit surprising
'cause it really doesn't like
genuinely doesn't feel like work because it's actually fun
And that begs the question that well okay
how do we actually enjoy the things that we're doing
I'm glad you asked because
there's again two broad ways of tackling this
The first one is the one that like
books and stuff will tell you
which is that find your passion
and do the things that you enjoy
That's like one way of doing it
The problem with that type of thinking
the whole find your passion and do what you enjoy
is that a lots of us don't know what our passion is
It's like you know I don't know what my passion is
What am I passionate about
who knows
Secondly the things I'm passionate about
like I dunno playing "World of Warcraft"
and trying to play songs on the guitar
I'm never gonna be able to make a living
at playing "World of Warcraft"
or playing all the songs on the guitar
And if I tried I'd be like you know what
I'm gonna become one of those 0.01%
of single song writers who make it big in the world
You know the deck is stacked against me
the odds are stacked against me
And the third problem with this whole narrative
of find your passion and do what you love
and all that kind of crap is that it doesn't recognize
that we do often have to do things that we don't wanna do
Like unless you're born with a silver spoon up your behind
you probably don't have the freedom to just quit your job
and follow your passion
Your put your passion is art great
Don't worry about working
just become an artist full time
Most of us don't have that level of privilege
where we can just quit our jobs and follow our passion
And so when we're trying to answer this question
of how do we enjoy the journey
how do we have fun
That approach of like pick the fun things to work on
I don't think that works for most people
I think there is a second approach
and that's the one that I've been using
most of my life
The second approach is actually instead of
doing the things you enjoy
learning to enjoy the things that you're doing
and this approach is great
because it doesn't rely on any level of privilege
it doesn't rely on your external circumstances
All it relies on
is like using a few mindset shifts
and using a few like environmental tricks
and using a few tips and techniques and hacks
to make ourselves or rather to encourage ourselves
to enjoy more of the things that we're doing
And so genuinely that's the true secret of productivity
if you can learn to enjoy the journey
if you can learn to have fun journey before destination
then productivity takes care of itself
And so I wanna share five or so techniques
that I found really helpful in my life
over the last 10 years
that helped me enjoy the journey a little bit more
Tip number one and I've just spilled some tea
so as I wipe the tea take tip number one
is a mindset shift
And that's just having the mindset
that the thing that we're doing or the work
or whatever you wanna call it is gonna be fun
This is like absolutely game-changing;
anytime I've had a situation in my life
where I felt stressed or I felt unmotivated
or I felt like ugh I'm not being productive enough
usually it's because I forgot to have fun
And there's a great phrase
that the philosopher Alan Watts used
which is about approaching things sincerely
versus approaching things seriously
And I often find myself approaching things too seriously
like you know it's no fun playing a game
with someone who's taking it too seriously
And so when I remember to have fun
I switched to approaching things sincerely
like I'm still gonna give it my all
but I'm gonna recognize that this is a game
and I'm gonna try and enjoy myself while I'm doing it
In fact I even have a post-it note
attached to my computer monitor at all times
that says this is going to be fun
And anytime I find my you know
I just I'm looking around and I catch a glimpse
of that post-it note this is gonna be fun
I just remind myself oh yeah this is gonna be fun
This is fine
This is all good
I don't need to feel that work is suffering
I can just treat it as a game and have fun along the way
Tip number two is all about turning things into a game
Now this used to be a very popular
like corporate speak thing back in the day
I think about 10 years ago
gamification is all about gamification
And if you gamified you workplace
then the employees would be more motivated
and more productive
And so the word gamification
a lot of people now like vom a little bit in their mouth
when they hear it
because it just sounds so you know
it harks back to that era
But I think gamification
is actually like absolutely game changing
So for example when I was going through medical school
in my first year of med school I really really struggled
because I had the mindset of this is supposed to be hard
And I just didn't have the thought
like I could treat this as a game
but in my second year of medical school
I started treating things more as a game
And so when I would make my revision timetables
I'd kind of write down all the subjects I need just to know
and then I would color code them
based on how well I knew them
And so they would all start off as red
and then as I got better at them they'd go yellow
and then they go green
And just that kind of color coding
helped me think of it more as a game
And so when I'd be studying
I'd be looking forward to testing myself with active recall
and then I'd be looking forward
to that box on my Google sheet turning green
and just that added element of a game of finding the process
made it so much more fun to study
and it also helped me get a first class degree
in my second year exams
which I hadn't done in my first year
when I thought things were gonna be really really hard
Tip number three for making stuff more fun
is to bring others on board
is to do things with your friends
Again I've got a story for med school about this
So in my fifth year of med school
I had a project that I was doing
that involves analyzing data from like 2000 patient records
and manually going through them
on the electronic patient record system
in order to like tease out some things around
you know what medication they were on
and what their results of an ultrasound scan were
the details are kind of irrelevant
The point is this was a lot of mind numbingly
boring dull grunt work having to go through a spreadsheet
And it didn't really require any like special knowledge
on my part other than a cursory knowledge of medicine
to know what sort of things I was looking for
And so I tried doing like a few dozens of patients
by myself and realize that this is the worst thing ever
I'm so unproductive I'm so unmotivated
I can't be bothered to do this thing
I wanna realize I could do
is I could bring friends on board
So I had some friends who I had like five friends
in the year below and I recruited them into this project
I said to them "All right guys
"we've got these 2000 patients to get through
"We'll split the workload up five ways
"So we do 400 patients each or 300 patients each,"
or whatever it was
"And then we'll all get our names
"on the paper that we ultimately try and publish
"out of this thing."
And so in one evening we just managed to get this done
We went to the medical school library
sat in the computer room the five six of us
We ordered pizza
We had a bit of takeaway
We had donuts from the hospital canteen
and we just banged out these this work over the space
of about four hours and genuinely was quite fun
We had music in the background
it was good times all around
And so we go through all 2,000 patients
we wrote on the paper it got published
so we got our names on a publication
and that paper even ended up getting presented
at a conference in Singapore
where I flew with some other friends
and we presented it there
and it was really cool
And all that happened
I think if I'd been doing it myself
if I hadn't just taken that extra step
to get other people on board
this project wouldn't have happened
and I wouldn't have had so many CV points
and I wouldn't have had a free trip to Singapore
And so the general tip here is that like think about
whatever you're doing
think about how you can do it with other people
You know when I was in med school again
studying for exams but with friends around me
it just made everything much more fun
And there are all sorts of aspects of our lives
in which we can apply this principle
Tip number four is to actually really think
about setting the appropriate stage
for our productivity in service of this thing of like
we wanna be trying to have more fun
And so for me I often think about like the tools
and the environment around me as making something more fun
So for example if I have a nice little teapot it's in blue
blue is my favorite color and this coral mug
this is kind of nice
I've got my MacBook here
I've got a little sleeve on it case thing
this whole aesthetic makes me really enjoy
for example if I was studying for an exam
or if I was kind of working on a video script
Sitting on here it would be quite fun
I'm quite enjoying making this video
because you know I've got this stuff around me
I've got my little fake plants
The environment around me is like I've designed in a way
that appeals to my personal aesthetic sensibilities
and therefore whatever I do in this environment
automatically becomes more fun
This is the same principle behind why
I like to have a fancy-ass desk set up
and you don't even need to have a fancy-ass desk
set up for this 'cause when I was in med school
and I was broken I had no money
I still put in time and effort to thinking okay
how do I arrange my books and my laptop on my desk
And like add this little plant
How do I arrange it in a way that makes me feel good inside
Because when it comes to studying for my exams
if I'm in my room and I'm on my desk I'm doing it
I just have more fun when the environment is more aesthetic
and more nice
Other things around this is working with music
I have a "Study With Me" playlist on Spotify
that has instrumental music
from like the "Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter"
and "Pirates of the Caribbean" and the "Marvel" stuff
I wanna have that playing on the speakers
or through my headphones it makes the work more fun
And yes according to the evidence
studying with music working with music
does reduce focus very very slightly
because it interferes with some aspects of like
short term memory processing but that's fine
I don't care
I would rather have a bit more fun by listening to music
then squeeze out a little bit of extra productivity
by working in complete silence
And so the tip here is that if you're worried
about your productivity or about motivation or whatever
just think about the environment that you're in
and ask yourself does it like
is that an environment that appeals to your aesthetics
is it conducive towards having fun
Because if it's conducive
to enjoying the process enjoying the journey
then you'll automatically magically become more productive
And tip number five is kind of if we're thinking ahead
like we can get to a point we're very good
at talking ourselves and tricking ourselves into having fun
we're doing the things that we're doing
you know bringing friends on board
changing the environment
the mindset and like a load of other things
that I haven't talked about in this video
But we've got to ask ourselves at some point
are we actually even working on the right things
Because if you have a job that feels ultimately meaningless
then there's only so much hacking that you can do
to make yourself enjoy it
But the fact that it's ultimately meaningless
will come back to bite you and you'll be unfulfilled
because the job is ultimately meaningless
And this question of meaning is like a really important part
of productivity because you know there's very little point
in driving a hundred miles per hour
if you find yourself driving in the wrong direction
There's another metaphor I like which is that
there's no point climbing up a ladder
if the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall
And so the question becomes
how do we find the things that are meaningful to us
that feel worth pursuing
Honestly I don't have the answers
but there are lots of exercises that I found really helpful
for thinking about the question
around how do we figure out what's meaningful to us
And I talk about quite a lot of these in my online classes
around productivity that are hosted on Skillshare
who are very kindly sponsoring this video
at the moment I've got four classes
related to the idea of productivity
meaning fulfillment enjoyment all of that sort of stuff

are mine
So three of them are on productivity
one of them is quite recent
it's specifically on productivity for creators
It talks about my secrets to productivity
for doing things like this YouTube channel
And I've even got a one hour class
that we recorded through Skillshare live
where I was giving I think three exercises
for how I personally find things that are meaningful
and fulfilling to me
Again I'm not saying I have the answers for this
but like these exercises genuinely helped me
to make sure that the stuff I'm working on
feels like it has a purpose
and that also contributes to my productivity
and enjoyment of life in a nice way
