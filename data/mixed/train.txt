all connected you know it ' s life is it	51 42 51 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
But it ' s quite hard to get started with this stuff	40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49 49 40 40 41
what made them into the great actors	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
could be the best actor who read for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
talking about when you ' re on set as a	76 76 76 76 76 76 67 67 76 76
brought back for a callback they usually	70 70 70 70 79 76 79
actor ' s career	71 71 71 67
actors for their student films	41 50 49 49 49
aftra and the cost for joining the union	68 68 68 68 71 67 67 44
the casting process	76 80 71
so that ' s how an agent makes money they	49 49 49 49 50 41 77 77 77 53
classes if your	79 80 76
whole story	41 68
directly that ' s why it is so important	68 68 68 68 41 40 41 71 41
should have done more theater i should	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
let ' s say you buy a property for three	11 11 11 10 10 10 10 10 20 20
and if you let imposter syndrome stop	79 79 79 76 79 79 79
you ' re trying to do it and why you	79 79 79 76 76 79 79 76 79 79
the actors with	79 79 79
to pay for the app is an entirely different kettle of fish	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
looking for then now is your opportunity	41 71 41 49 79 79 70
fee or you know you can do it yourself	40 41 41 41 68 41 40 40 41
properties and yeah it ' s just really	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
services and products and those are sort	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all of us actors we don ' t know what	52 52 52 79 79 52 52 52 79 79
the term side simply refers to pages of	79 49 40 40 40 40 40 40
on camera actor can do	50 50 50 71 71
in that market and a lot of times those	71 71 71 79 79 79 79 79 80
get my agent in atlanta so when i was	40 41 41 41 41 40 40 40 40
what is the purpose of sag - aftra well	68 68 68 71 71 71 71 71 68
eating should be treated as a privilege	41 49 49 49 40 49 49
dollars back i truly do know like having	42 45 77 77 50 50 41 76
organized with your life and your	79 52 52 79 79 79
the objective here is to meet working	68 68 70 70 68 68 70
fastest internet unless you ' re uploading	79 43 79 79 79 79 71
then you get those residual payments but	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
with it and sometimes people that are	50 50 49 49 49 49 49
and I shouldn ' t do it	67 40 67 67 67 67 70
" And then we ' ll all get our names	70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71 80 71
and so people have asked me you know do	79 79 79 79 79 73 73 76 79
without having an	80 80 71
education out there and i think for most	0 0 79 79 79 79 79 79
would stop all that and I would	41 19 19 50 41 41 41
give it to them right away you should be	41 41 41 41 41 40 40 40 40
encourage you because so many actors	71 71 41 41 49 49
get started the first technique is to	49 49 50 76 68 41 41
is where the people looking for a	79 79 79 79 79 70 70
they ' re not really doing very much for you	49 49 49 49 50 49 76 76 76 67
did I took my real - estate course online	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
over the last like four years	79 49 49 79 79 79
focused on	77 80
my computer and I see a file named	67 67 67 77 77 77 77 76
them for me and she knows my brand voice	79 79 79 73 73 73 76 79 79
actors and if you don ' t have a demo reel	41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
much about the filmmaking process so if	49 49 40 41 50 50 41
pay you to do something	76 76 76 76 50
up there i call it my audition	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
Equally if you ' re going down the service route	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 70 79 70
going on so not only are you getting	68 71 49 49 49 70 70 70
lot of us only use the printer to print	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
enjoy myself while I was there	80 81 81 80 49 49
pay for over the Internet and these are	68 68 68 68 76 76 76 76
So advertisers can then pay to show their ads	31 31 40 28 40 40 40 40 40
story of some kind so if you ' re able to	68 71 71 71 71 49 49 49 49 49 71
of those places so now i know a lot of	71 71 80 79 70 71 71 71 71 71
may seem high to you um but you got to	49 79 49 79 79 70 43 43 43 71
10 % in Johnson and Johnson all of that sort of stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
posted publicly so that you	79 79 79 79 79
or worth more this time next year	71 49 79 70 70 70 76
posted publicly	79 79
learn more from me about and email is	79 79 71 80 71 71 71 71
would write	0 0
they are thinking that of you	71 71 71 71 71 68
completely free of charge for example if	49 49 22 49 41 49 49
trust your gut when the role seems a	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
worth having let ' s say	70 79 70 70 70 70
for that particular video look so abysmal	67 70 67 68 68 67 71
and therefore you kinda get income tax on that amount	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 15
But I think this approach	71 41 41 49 67
start with something available in school	79 52 49 41 71 71
as an indication that you can take your	41 41 68 41 41 71 71 71
want to be able to have a track record	79 79 79 79 79 52 52 52 52
i drove two hours to pittsburgh i did my	26 44 44 71 71 71 44 44 71
acting gigs available the vast	80 80 80 79 79
time they see you on camera and then	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
interested in now some auditions don	79 77 77 79 80 79
your headshot your resume right there in	49 49 50 71 71 71 71
casting directors will be having trouble	80 49 50 50 77 80
So you you do you and stop worrying about it so much	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
need to find people who are willing to	53 43 43 53 53 53 53 53
because I was so in my head about the	71 71 41 49 19 19 19 22 49
or people with neck tattoos or people	49 68 67 70 71 52 52
learning to enjoy the things that you ' re doing	43 43 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
in purely passive income	67 67 68 68
here and not just try to take a good	79 79 76 77 77 81 81 81 81
they ' re here so	41 41 41 41 40
get into the house right now	70 71 71 71 71 79
link that little video down below too if	53 53 53 68 49 71 71 71
to actually go to the class they	71 70 70 79 79 79 70
having an inbox for your brain	49 49 49 49 52 50
the book Sharon has a chapter called	41 41 50 49 49 76 76
in the industry and i still take classes	68 68 68 71 71 52 52 52
I did disc in my back I tore my	49 49 50 50 50 50 50 50 23
invest in your headshot because it is	50 71 71 71 49 49 41
linked in the video description	40 40 32 44 44
credit utilization at 30 length of	40 68 52 79 40 53
it allows people to leverage money at	1 41 40 40 40 41 40
has continued to help me to this very	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
be replicated out in the real world now	41 41 41 50 50 50 50 40
actually afford to spend more money but	67 67 40 67 76 76 49
and therefore you don ' t have to pay	76 76 79 67 67 67 79 79 79
saying oh i ' m a really good actor i want	40 40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
The first one is something that I call	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is like the most valuable thing	31 31 31 58 58 55
I should have been ready to perform and	50 50 77 80 80 80 80 77
what ' s the best place to live to start	41 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 68 71
those talent agents aren ' t necessarily	43 43 71 80 80 80 50
pursuing my business	79 79 79
someone if you can listen and respond	40 40 40 40 41 41 41
need recessed lights now these are the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
broken 22 bones I ' ve separated his	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
that could match those expenses you have	79 79 79 76 80 80 80
eyeballs on me and therefore leading to	79 79 52 52 79 79 79
Old school like boomer level territory	70 70 70 49 49 49
case and so and so for your example you	41 41 41 40 41 41 41 41 40
can seem like a really complicated black box	79 79 16 25 79 79 0 0
500 000 which means that there is a	20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
go wrong so the more people that you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the odds are stacked against me	41 41 41 41 50 50
is theater	0 0
you definitely don ' t have to be like a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
put all the headshots of their top	49 19 19 19 19 19 19
work that i ' ve done	76 49 49 49 49 49
the producers of the movie hire a	50 80 80 80 40 61 61
not to look for things on sale but	79 79 79 70 70 61 61 40
isn ' t gonna make much difference to your life	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51
because of this I can ' t do this because	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
you should definitely head over to brilliant	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
eventually decide to cast me	40 31 40 41 71

" Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion	49 49 49 49 67 68 32 41 41 68 68 68 68
relatively late compared to i guess a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
business more	79 79
but the way that you can essentially optimize that luck	21 21 0 0 20 20 47 47 0 0
one is really looking over shoulder all	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your own	0 0

somebody checking people in at the front	49 49 71 71 71 71 71
pretty well	0 79
I don ' t even do these boring fundamentals	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and the most obvious is that you ' re only	31 31 10 10 31 31 31 31 31 31
interviewing or talking to we ' ve seen	67 41 41 41 49 49 49 41
then let me know down in the comments	76 76 76 77 77 41 41 44
and commercial properties can be great	70 79 79 79 79 79
absolutely make a ton of money for	79 70 71 71 79 70 70
in order to study for the actual state	49 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
social gatherings or networking events	70 70 79 71 71
but basically I ' m not making anything until April 2018	67 68 71 71 71 68 67 49 41 41 49
There ' s so much to explore in this area	77 77 77 81 80 80 80 80 80 80
And the idea is that YouTube sells these ad slots	40 37 31 28 28 31 40 40 70 61
it ' s just like what I ' m doing in here	42 42 42 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50 50
playing field they don	46 46 46 46
say you ' re auditioning for a soldier it	41 41 41 41 50 79 79 79 79
highest grade internet is just going to	43 70 70 70 40 49 49
we can and should share the things that we ' ve discovered	52 52 16 43 43 52 79 52 52 52 52 43
you have done a commercial for competing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Also loads more people are on YouTube than on podcasts	70 52 52 52 52 79 79 79 79 79
sorry for the change in scenery i	31 31 31 31 67 67 67
you ' re going to impact and serve certain	80 80 80 79 79 79 79 79 79
in a play a movie a TV show or you	44 53 80 80 71 71 71 79 49 49
the internet might vary from place to	70 43 61 67 67 40 79
ideas because they ' re also like amazing	79 52 52 52 52 49 49 49
Point number 20	76 52 49
right when a casting director or an	50 50 80 80 71 67 70
because you ' re making 10K a year	70 40 40 40 79 79 77 76
would think about those things and	79 79 79 79 79 79
real estate is for sure	40 79 79 49 49
received all of those headshots resumes	67 71 71 71 67 67
know it ' s got to be sustainable for you	42 50 50 50 50 51 51 50 49 49
want to see that you are still currently	79 77 76 79 79 80 80 71
while you ' re there you might as well check	70 70 70 70 79 76 76 79 79 79
usually between twenty dollars and sixty	71 71 71 71 71 71
their bank accounts and they wonder	37 37 40 40 40 0

take a class if you ' re just getting	71 71 71 71 68 68 68 71 71

that ' s outside of your control	43 43 43 43 43 43 43
it ' s like	71 71 71 71
early remember that once you become a	71 41 41 41 41 40 40
we tend to trust more because we ' ve seen	79 79 79 79 79 70 71 71 71 49
thing you can do is think what types of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
an FHA loan then your credit score only	70 79 79 70 70 70 70 70
motivations and the relationships that	67 64 67 37 40
i . e you own more than 37 , 500 pounds a year which I do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 81 79 79 79 79 79
and back when i was doing photography	79 80 52 49 49 50 73
video if you enjoyed it please give it a	79 79 79 79 79 76 76 76 79
they were debating now for a	43 43 43 70 41 41
difference because the most important	76 76 73 74 73

basic is selling other people ' s products	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 51
if I had started investing from 2009	70 70 70 70 71 70 70
five thousand K which is gonna be a very	43 34 35 70 79 79 70 70 79
fixer - uppers and doing some of these	31 31 31 31 31 32 31 31
should be looking at the quality of the	50 49 49 50 50 41 41 41
for a house unless of course you are	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
So that was a really important lesson that I learnt	76 76 67 67 67 70 67 67 70 70
and put them into a stock market index fund	67 67 76 76 70 67 70 70 70
on self - improvement every single day	70 79 79 79 79 79 79
in a really good position to jump into	70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
sheet from	41 41
is so much better for you	76 70 70 71 71 71
groups associated with acting and	0 0 0 0 0
works best for you but I just want you	71 71 71 71 77 79 76 79 79
because it ' s going to be virtually	70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71
Because to be an online broker in a country	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51
for sponsoring this video	79 70 70 70
and they shot shaq ' s parts	49 49 41 41 41 41 41
something like a white or a light gray	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and you just kind of work through it to get it	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 37 37 40 37
using props and auditions ok so what	71 71 71 71 80 77 80
mark or though say hey can we walk over	68 71 71 44 53 53 53 44 44
successful real estate agent I recommend	79 70 70 70 70 70
needed so what I would do is go on	31 40 31 31 31 37 40 40 40
people that live in another country but	67 67 70 43 50 50 71
it can go up to about 30 or $ 40 per thousand views	67 67 67 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on them but instead i took that energy	40 40 40 40 37 10 10 41
totally makes sense yeah and so another	37 41 41 41 41 41 41
about you know having this marble statue	6 6 6 6 6 6 6
share with you a couple tips from two	77 80 80 80 79 79 79 79
bathroom but it actually makes a lot of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
everyone is going to have learned	53 40 40 40 31 67
another really fun thing about becoming	40 40 40 40 67 40
have stairs that ' s gonna cost a lot more	79 79 79 79 79 70 79 70 70 79
in a college town you can rent out maybe	1 1 1 79 49 49 49 79 79
improvised scenario is to try to	50 50 50 71 53 53
theater they want to be	54 80 54 54 79
in the gym so that we ' re stronger in our	40 40 40 40 40 41 41 41 41 40 41
Again I ' m not saying I have the answers for this	41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
as well as you ' re acting while you	67 67 67 40 40 40 37 40 67
successful in real estate you want to be	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
reel immediately this is the way to	40 40 40 40 40 50 49
some people think that getting an agent	77 77 77 77 77 77 50
for my auditions I don ' t use all seven	40 40 40 68 68 68 68 67 67 67
theater before they move into film and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that has a lot of my other videos about	41 68 68 41 41 41 68 68 41
nutrition side of it too yeah so all of	41 41 40 40 40 40 41 40 40
matter what it is it has to be something	67 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
here in the united states i know there	52 49 49 79 79 71 71 41
in industrial videos and industrial	71 71 40 40 49
which I think is true for a lot of us	58 67 67 67 67 67 67 40 49 50
you have control over that and if you	44 53 53 53 77 80 71 80
possible to become a working actor in my	70 70 70 70 70 70 79 79
you can either find a tenant yourself	31 40 37 31 31 31 31
that most people will consider hollywood	79 79 79 79 79 79
first it goes down from 50K to 27	58 37 19 13 40 58 58 55
is my friend Anne - Laure who runs a website called Ness Labs	49 49 52 43 43 43 53 53 80 79 52 80 43
years if you had	62 71 79 79
three hours when people think about it	49 49 22 22 22 49 49
single time so having a little recorder	70 67 40 40 40 67 67
consideration depending on where you	50 71 50 50 50
And that means that when I ' m doing	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 46
and gone through all the hoops and stuff	37 67 64 67 67 67 67 64

you ' ve moved in and started renting out	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your very best presentation is key in this industry	41 71 71 71 71 68 71 71 71
one of the producers told me he said hey	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

" Why don ' t you just make it a write off day ?"	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
is a bunch of information associated	50 50 44 71 71 41
worth a lot more than 50	70 79 79 79 79 70
doesn ' t necessarily mean that that movie	76 76 76 77 77 77 77 77
missing out on those huge gains of	31 31 31 28 28 28 31

you need to think why you want to get a	71 79 49 49 79 79 79 79 79 79
starbucks versus making it at home	52 49 79 76 79 79
you know I didn ' t lose weight today I	41 41 41 49 49 49 50 41 41 49

you can add some personality but if your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 71
then productivity kind of just takes care of itself	49 49 50 49 49 49 41 50 77
that the thing that we ' re doing or the work	40 41 41 41 41 41 41 49 50 41 49
I think I was making $ 100 a month	41 41 41 41 50 41 41 40 49
the reader their voice is louder than	76 76 73 76 76 77 77

is gonna be useful	41 41 41 41
you need to consider when choosing a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
shame yourself for not having the	49 49 49 49 21 6
and put it on their scene partner to	20 24 51 51 50 50 50 50
feeling called to do it	79 79 79 79 79

hopefully that makes sense that ' s the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49
So again and I can ' t state this emphatically enough	34 34 52 79 70 70 70 70 70 52 52
agent because they want to see someone	70 70 79 79 79 79 79

call up the union make a phone call and	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67

that this business currently generates	41 41 44 49 49

getting started it ' s important to be	71 71 79 79 79 79 79 79
up whenever your tent moves out you	79 79 79 79 61 79 79
embarrassed and the thing is we never	71 71 71 49 79 79 49

belichick who is a local pittsburgh	71 71 71 71 71 71
away content for free people won ' t buy	71 68 68 49 49 49 49 49 49
really just concerned about the film and	71 80 50 77 77 68 68
hundred thousand dollars of profit	31 31 40 31 13
script for either audition purposes or	49 41 71 71 67 67
really get to show that reacting part of	40 40 67 70 70 61 61 70
it so	71 71
cesar hobby and go and apply now if ever	74 68 71 71 71 71 71 44 44
agent and we ' re not talking about being	49 76 77 77 77 77 80 80 80
casting director	61 40
so many different streaming services	62 61 79 79 79
helped me book over fifty movies and	76 76 76 76 76 76 80
actor and free wi - fi and a balcony and a	71 71 71 41 41 41 41 41 79 79 79
When you read these books	52 52 52 52 52
not having enough money to pay your	40 43 70 70 50 50 80
pay directly for the product	49 49 49 49 50
And that is sort of the sort of fun	67 67 67 49 49 80 50 49 49
whereby hopefully you kind of learn together	61 49 79 79 67 76 76
these different things	31 31 31
or if you got that from learning in a	79 79 79 79 80 77 77 50 50
there is something that happens during	40 71 67 67 67 67
conversation with a lot of people as	40 41 41 41 50 50 49
essentially it was just like I just	50 50 50 41 49 49 49
better position to succeed because it	42 51 51 51 51 51
because having those consistent bookings	79 52 79 79 79
for something is that you identify a problem that they have	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 40
So new hair I ' ve got my Invisalign braces on	41 71 71 40 40 40 70 71 52 79 70
it ' s not the first thing you should be	76 76 76 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
that audition by mistake but in	79 79 79 70 70 70
oh come on mate that ' s obvious	67 67 67 64 64 64 64 64
ahead of themselves	70 70 67
have a little income and have it be	46 19 46 46 46 46 50 50
that was able to bring in an equity	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 52
idea how to answer it but the whole	79 71 71 71 71 71 41 41
uniform all the other actors myself	79 77 76 79 76 77
aside jobs sometimes multiple side jobs	52 52 52 52 52 52
when he dies that I become the president	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
duplex or triplex and pay little to	79 79 79 79 76 79 79

And my favorite blogger Mr Money Mustache	76 76 76 67 67 67 67
or i put a link down in the description	44 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
for having ideas not for storing them	43 43 43 52 25 25 25
independence then hit the playlist over	71 37 37 37 67 70
because you bought it at $ 79 in February	53 52 52 52 52 25 25 52 22
to the private mortgage insurance	70 70 70 79 79
price it higher than that ' s probably not	43 43 43 43 79 79 79 43 43
that next year this home is gonna be	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
gigabytes of files per day or per month	31 61 61 79 79 43 79 70

learning and i can ' t wait to see you on	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 0 0
we ' ve heard that let me tell you what a	41 41 41 71 71 71 41 41 41 41 40
four different ways to get auditions	77 77 68 68 71 71
of the shoot a callback is a	71 70 70 70 67 62 62
I only named a few but these are some of	52 79 79 79 71 71 79 62 70 79
so please feel free to share in the	70 70 64 67 67 58 58 58
job what this pretty much means is you	31 31 40 40 40 31 31 40
implement these things right now	70 43 43 40 70
the details are kind of irrelevant	49 41 71 71 71 71
all right we got a lot to cover in this	68 50 50 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
probably wondering the same thing I was	79 79 79 70 67 70 70
that ' s backing up your words with proof	67 67 67 67 67 67 68 68 68
is by something called dividends	54 51 54 51 51
examples so say I have an audition for a	71 71 67 67 67 67 67 67 70
who wrote a famous essay ages ago called	77 77 49 49 49 49 49 40
being how young they are because they	71 71 71 71 71 71 67
he says he makes between 10 , 000 and $ 100 , 000 per video	49 44 79 79 52 25 25 25 52 52 52 52 52 50 80
character in the way that feels most	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
afraid to turn things down yes they	50 50 50 50 50 50 49
during that month you need to study	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
or the S & amp ; P 500 which is the 500 biggest companies	31 55 31 31 31 31 31 55 55 55 40 49 70 70
then you know you might as well do it	40 37 37 67 40 31 31 31 40
said see	79 79
and sit down and figure out how much you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 52 79
basis of acting ability alone clients	49 49 49 71 71 71
your actual course you take that final	40 41 41 49 49 49 40
think we could greatly benefit from	77 44 44 71 71 64
then i was pretty confident that i would	79 79 80 80 80 79 79 79
where to move okay now let me talk to	41 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
tv and radio hosts and some other	71 44 80 71 71 71 80
something for access to that service	19 49 49 41 49 49
i recommend you just go to google and do	71 40 71 71 40 41 71 71 71
audition script if you covered up the	40 40 40 43 70 43 43
I just wanna go onto the next one	1 1 1 -159 1 21 1 79
many people aren ' t many of you may only	40 49 40 40 40 40 40 40 41 41
are some factors that are out of our	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
that the casting director will then	49 49 70 70 79 79
called the Part - Time YouTuber Academy	40 49 49 49 49 49 49
posted casting calls on each website	71 71 79 79 79 76
This is an idea that my brother came up with	70 70 76 52 79 52 67 67 67 67
if we wanna earn $ 100 a month passively	76 73 64 79 70 70 70 70 70
then you could live in one unit and rent	71 70 70 70 61 79 79 61 79
right because it ' s one of the biggest	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so if you ' re interested in doing these	41 50 50 50 50 40 40 41 41
is to improvise a scenario where you	50 49 52 52 50 77 53
is by offering up our money	0 0 0 0 0 0
they end up paying	79 79 79 79
or climbing a mountain or doing cross country skiing	76 73 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
which is " God grant me the strength to accept that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49 79
everyone needs to do i see too many	70 70 70 70 79 79 76 76
first time here make sure to subscribe	68 68 68 68 68 69 69
actors dressing in full costume for	76 76 79 79 76 79
stress enough how important this is	70 70 71 71 71 71
that ' s not working I ' ll try another if I	52 52 52 52 49 67 67 67 67 70 71 49
if you like this video please give it a	71 71 71 71 49 49 49 49 70
investor by buying and selling yourself	0 79 49 79 79 79
and then automating or delegating aspects of that business	49 40 40 40 49 49 49 67 58
job needs to be something that we	71 71 80 80 50 50 50
finally booked me	50 53 50
time if not then	79 79 79 71
pretty impressive	79 79
let ' s get started so the first one on	22 22 22 70 71 71 41 41 40 49
director or a client might ask you tell	71 80 52 49 71 71 71 49
generally apply otherwise so make sure	49 49 49 41 41 41
my list is buying internet that is just	70 79 71 79 70 79 52 79
But if you pick the right sort of video topic	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
things change for example sometimes the	70 70 70 70 43 70
the time and when you are your own boss	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
there are a lot of ways around that so	71 71 71 70 70 70 71 49 79
you don ' t have any money left so that	49 49 49 49 76 76 49 53 53 71
money and all that time	41 41 41 41 71
because each thing kind of builds on itself	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
name is kurt yu thank you so much for	68 77 77 41 41 79 49 49 41
it ' s really fun	50 50 50 50 41
the casting director is gonna be pissed	49 49 49 52 52 52 52
as soon as they hit your brain so that you can then	22 22 22 50 49 49 79 70 70 70 70 70
But secondly it ' s an investment	70 68 68 68 68 70 70
stay on top of their craft	0 0 0 0 0 0
actually looks	0 0
and didn ' t realize how easy it is and that it ' s a thing	76 76 76 76 49 40 49 76 70 67 67 67 67 67 67 43

that course I found that real estate	67 40 40 40 31 40 67
spending money like you ' re rich	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
it would be probably going overboard to	14 14 14 14 14 14 0

yeah it probably is so be wary of anyone	71 71 71 71 80 80 80 79 79
we ' ll save that for another video my	71 71 71 49 41 71 71 71 71
about how	52 79
it ' s provided you keep showing up	76 76 76 52 53 49 52 49

all i want to do is help you guys save	70 43 43 43 43 52 52 70 70 52
I got the audition it was for a police	49 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

any benefits or any of those things	80 41 71 68 71 71 71
i ' ll post below it shows you how you can	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
afford what they ' re gonna do is they	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
once you ' re making $ 100 a month it ' s actually a lot easier	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50 50 50
It ' s a bit old fashioned	58 58 58 58 58 58 58
research all the big markets see what	80 77 67 70 71 80 80
that you ' re willing to give up all of	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51
is through their guidance	70 70 79 79
how to answer the question but I never	41 53 53 53 50 41 41 41
and this approach is great	49 40 40 31 31
and that ' s the first thing that they ask	80 80 80 80 81 79 79 79 79 79
and it also helped me get a first class degree	0 64 64 65 67 67 67 67 67 67
almost four years now I want to say is	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
that you can put into your solo 401k	28 31 31 40 49 49 40 31
a free 10 - step audition preparation	40 40 40 40 40 40 68
anything that is related to your	76 40 67 40 67 70
depreciation schedules next up is that	31 32 49 49 49 46
consideration well like i mentioned	71 80 80 77 80
and trying to play songs on the guitar	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
separate piece of paper	49 49 46 77
you definitely want to subscribe to this	53 53 71 71 71 71 71
to one record and stop of the camera I	40 71 68 71 68 71 71 76 52
have to move to germany to do that	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 40
is a relatively safe way of doing this	49 52 79 71 70 79 49 79
footage back that you can put onto your	80 77 77 80 80 80 80 80
hey kurt give me a status hey shaq this	49 49 49 49 50 49 71 71 41
and nothing good ever happens and you just wanna sleep	79 79 79 79 79 79 77 77 71 79
other costs associated with holding	40 31 31 31 31
doctor on that show and i ' m in episode	79 70 80 71 71 71 71 71 53 80
their careers they decide they want to	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
have to make sure	79 79 79 79
so let ' s take a look at my answer right	68 65 65 65 68 68 68 68 68 68 68
is such a massive source of stress in	71 53 53 80 53 50 76 49
that they are today	79 79 79 79
and it was just really nice	67 67 67 67 67 64
between being union and non - union well	40 70 50 80 41 41 41 41
invest in real estate they need to buy a	44 40 40 41 41 41 41 40 40
" I hated every minute of training	44 44 71 49 49 49 49
description so if they can if if they	46 41 49 47 50 50 49 49
lose her the role that worked for her	79 79 79 79 76 79 71 71
Another example is my YouTuber friend Oliur	25 52 0 0 0 0 0
and we presented it there	70 43 53 44 53
days you might be meeting new people	67 67 67 40 40 40 40
however don ' t listen to that don ' t think	79 70 70 70 71 70 70 70 70 70 79
off because this is who they called in	49 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
bringing in any income	76 79 52 79
about how hard it is to get started	49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41
haven ' t seen that	41 41 41 41 41
with our memorization with lines you	41 41 41 41 41 41
carbs and if you ' re someone who loves	41 41 41 50 50 50 50 41 41
on his YouTube channel he talks about	63 72 72 71 63 63 67
this is what you really want and you	50 51 51 81 81 71 40 40
and more importantly to my mum who ' s watching	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
some of the actors that they really	70 71 71 67 67 67 43
the key is really to not overthink it	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 79
now this is actually a heavily debated	67 68 71 71 67 67 67
be very very smart so first up is being	40 40 67 67 40 40 40 67 40
a server side language like Python	49 49 49 0 0 0
bigger and more significant portion of	43 70 70 70 70 70
but just don ' t forget to you know as they say	79 79 79 79 79 71 79 79 79 79 79 79
that ' s the big set up but I show people	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
just do kind of an	71 67 70 70 70
that there might be call backs there	68 71 71 68 58 62 71
small business from when i started my	79 79 79 79 71 41 44
Whereas otherwise I ' m just in kind of technician mode	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 49 49 49 46
like a Tesla Model 3 for the business	81 81 81 72 72 81 81 79
acting auditioning and career advice	71 71 71 71 71
you do have to join the union after a	78 78 72 78 78 78 78 71 71
asked me how old i was at the time i was	70 70 79 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
involved and audition for	40 40 49 50
and it ' s totally worth the price	79 79 79 79 79 49 79 79
and verified your identity	51 71 70 49
that they take a commission off of your	79 79 79 79 79 71 71 71
could completely change your whole real	79 79 79 79 79 79
video it ' s perfectly fine to shoot in	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
overall if you want to spend less money	70 43 43 79 52 70 71 61
really serious	80 80
ask yourself this do I currently own a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your belt when you go on to a bigger	79 79 79 70 76 79 79 79 79
if someone tells you hey can you please	73 73 76 76 79 79 79 79
to have the highest credit score you can	71 71 70 70 70 70 70 70
look at the television film and web	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in terms of gaining as much experience	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
about my thoughts on that and when you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
worry about	79 79
but also if you want to really do this	44 41 41 31 32 31 40 32 41
that ' s because agents and casting	50 50 50 67 70 71 71
with a monologue it can be applied to	50 50 50 40 40 40 50 77
with this kitchen a built - in stove lots	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
like there are some things i can talk	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
on my list	79 79 79
kind of newer in the industry or just	50 41 50 50 50 50 49 49
once I ' ve made them other than a reply to comments	59 58 58 58 58 58 61 61 58 70 70 71
you ' re all the way at the bottom at a	70 70 70 70 70 40 40 40 40 40 31
so that is a	79 79 80 80
did in 2015 we both know how to code and	40 37 37 67 40 40 49 49 49 49
video if you liked it please give it a	67 68 68 45 45 68 80 71 71
receding and there ' s a concept that she	0 0 0 0 0 76 79 80 80
and she mumbled over to the groom and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
something that never really crossed my	50 46 46 46 37 37
strategies if it is something where you	50 40 49 50 50 49 50
of actual work to keep it ticking along	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
characters lines beforehand you go in	49 80 67 67 67 67
can play mozart on the violin	52 79 79 79 79 79
Maybe not when you ' re asleep but basically every other time	79 76 79 76 76 76 76 76 79 80 80 79
like this I would start to run some	79 79 79 79 0 0 0 1
loan defaults it ' s a way for them to	0 0 79 79 79 70 70 70 70 70
about in the	79 79 79
and recovery which is why for the actors	40 40 40 40 40 49 49 49
of them like less than five percent get	70 40 41 41 71 71 71 71
poem from the early 1900 ' s that goes as	41 41 41 49 49 49 49 19 19 49
on them completely they are your guide	40 41 40 40 40 40 40
ten years in my career I ' ve done maybe	79 79 79 80 79 67 67 67 71 71
keep pushing forward now with all of	76 76 79 49 49 76 49
open house date so what we did was we	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
think 2017	41 41
thing that wasn ' t sustainable for me	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
like your drama club or school plays	41 67 67 71 71 79 79
turn them into a working actor but	79 79 79 79 79 49 49
Thank you so much for watching	40 40 40 40 70 79
out how much house you can actually	79 79 79 52 79 79 79
in New York City and you can do the same	71 71 71 71 71 70 71 71 71 71
they cuz sometimes just need that	49 49 49 49 49 49
and how you can do the same	76 76 49 40 40 40 40
maybe five thousand dollars resurface	79 79 79 79 79
Now you can avoid having to charge for your online courses	71 71 71 71 62 62 62 71 62 63 63
some point in the future	17 16 49 49 49
And once you ' ve written the whole day off	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
directly into the camera lens the next	71 71 71 71 70 70 70
And again this is not good	31 1 31 31 31 31
when they hear it	53 53 53 53
This first lesson that I shared	49 49 79 79 79 70
that affect how much an individual earns on YouTube	41 41 41 41 41 41 49 40 70
I ' m making like 50 pounds a day	32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
and you ' re buying a camera for example	18 51 51 51 46 51 15 15 46
experience the first thing that i want	71 71 49 49 49 49 49
and nail an audition but it also sucks because in real life	40 71 71 71 70 70 70 79 79 79 79 79
because if you can teach something and	76 41 81 81 81 81 81
there ' s a lot of like nutrition camps	32 32 32 32 41 47 47 38 47
beneficial from a full nutrient	50 50 50 50 50
see me in one scene well guess what the	40 40 41 68 71 71 41 68 67
refers to how an actor physically moves	71 71 70 62 71 70 71
your local area or owning properties	40 31 40 40 25 25
you can use that loss to offset other	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
properties that are too lavish	0 0 70 79 79
so is it possible to live in a house or	41 49 49 49 49 76 76 76 79 79
co - star here in the	0 0 0 0 0 0
that actors can supplement their income	40 40 40 40 40 70
sell the house you ' re gonna get that	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
point which is	40 49 70
spread but they look more bulky four	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
where we do these virtual classes for	50 41 49 49 49 46 46
lines one last time in my head to make	19 19 19 41 41 71 71 71 41
you learn the skills you need to break	68 68 68 71 71 71 71 71
not gonna look good at all so make sure	67 41 41 41 41 71 53 23 23
unless they are super super good you	31 31 31 58 61 31 31
is going to be the best route to take	31 31 31 31 31 40 31 31 61
and then telling that to the agent	64 76 76 76 71 71 76
we ' re gonna give the starting difficulty	52 52 52 49 68 60 55 58
then I ' ve created a free audit cheat	49 70 70 70 70 71 71 71 70
and that transformed the way my images	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you want to download my free audition	79 71 80 80 70 80 71 71
not you ' re being treated fairly if	71 71 71 71 71 80 80 80
co - founders you can go down the start	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
at that point your course needs to actually be good	50 50 41 68 68 49 41 41 71 71
because I think it ' s genuinely really good	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
they are adding valley to the house and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
credits to your resume but they also can	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
their movies throughout the year or	41 41 41 41 41 41
anywhere near as much as a day on set	70 80 53 53 53 53 53 53 71
where I ' m having fun	40 41 41 41 41 41
want to know all of these terms before	76 79 77 50 50 79 79 76
comes in and asks us to add this line	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
little bit too much for you yeah like	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
every week	71 71
The second way of making money from shares	61 61 70 70 70 67 70 70
say it that way and that we have to have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
well now is where we get into the second	41 68 71 71 71 44 50 80 80
as long as it ' s good obviously has to be	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
money so by understanding the way the	49 49 68 71 71 70 70
want to take on that by yourself and	40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41
or an internet entrepreneur	49 49 49 49
And so question number seven is	67 67 67 67 67 67
if you didn ' t like it and you totally	49 49 49 49 49 22 22 22 49 49
completely profile to the camera and the	22 40 40 67 64 73 76
and producers and everybody else in this	50 50 50 50 53 50 50
license with a brokerage and this is	40 40 40 40 40 40 49
now they ' re talking to the camera to the	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
want to work one - on - one I always want to	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
then keep watching this video because	71 41 41 71 71 71
to just fire them all out like a machine gun because we don ' t have to think about	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 71

Your put your passion is art great	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
georgia that ' s the case for many many	71 71 71 71 50 49 49 49 49
right up there now that you ' ve prepared	71 76 76 49 71 71 71 71 71
here ' s a head shot of my actor i promise	50 50 50 53 53 50 50 50 50 50 50
it ' d have to be a long workout how once	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
before committing to becoming a real	79 79 79 70 79 79
you just didn ' t necessarily fit those	79 79 80 80 80 79 79 79
going to be	11 11 19
in this video we are going over eight	79 79 79 79 79 79 63 63
about when you are further along in your	79 79 52 43 43 43 52 79
without really giving it much thought	76 76 76 49 49 49
for using it for personal reasons	51 51 51 51 51 15
was pinned for the role they were	76 79 79 79 79 79 76
down an average of 11 % truth be told the	79 71 71 70 79 79 79 40 71 71
you kind of plan for that is it is it	41 41 29 41 41 41 41 41 41 32
here as well	0 0 0
have any questions if you like this	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
downsides to just really make sure you	67 67 67 64 67 67 67
the uh social life that you ' ll have to	80 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
But then I started actively	70 70 70 70 70
each and every transaction so yeah let	40 40 31 67 40 40 40
i can ' t do it from where i live i would	79 79 79 79 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
the audition and this is the part that	52 49 50 50 80 80 79 76
- Hey friends	79 79 79
be where i am in my career right now had	79 79 80 80 80 77 77 80 80 79
comfortable with house hacking	70 34 61 61
I think no it ' s a flywheel	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
not very concise	70 70 70
in exchange for having them tape your	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
15 20 before you elect to join that	40 67 67 70 41 41 41 41
about about this one thing and the	41 41 19 19 19 19 19
and it ' s harder for me now to accept a	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
they now need to cast the movie right so	49 40 70 70 70 70 70 70 49
for that	41 41
you might have been thinking	67 40 40 67 67
gonna want something more like a 2700 K	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
then send it to them	68 68 41 41 71
they actually just spring for a	70 70 70 70 70 70
all these auditions and I didn ' t book a	79 70 79 49 50 71 71 71 71 71
you ' re ready to perform	79 79 79 79 79 79
at least once a week	60 60 58 58 67
such an online brand and a lot of the	49 49 79 79 67 67 67 67 71
you take the exam that ' s way worse than	40 40 40 40 13 13 13 40 41 41
background work does not go	0 0 0 0 0
20 or 30 dollars in 10 years because if	79 70 70 70 79 79 79 79 70
that wasn ' t a part of the audition it	32 33 33 33 29 29 29 29 29 29
represent that fit	76 76 73
auditions you ' ve got to get better at	71 50 50 50 80 53 54 54 53
are more credits i just don ' t list	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and your online casting profiles like	40 70 70 70 70 71
maybe a few thousand dollars of mortgage	70 70 70 70 70 79 79
i knew that now that they ' re shooting	79 52 79 79 52 79 79 79 79
doing that that we are amateurs so this	52 52 40 40 40 49 40 41
with something ask yourself how hard should this really be	52 79 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 70
2008 I walked into my very first acting	70 79 79 79 40 50 80 70
it ' s important to go to a professional	67 67 67 67 70 70 70 70 70
rather than the window opener attitude	49 71 49 79 49 49
biggest reason why people fail the test	40 49 49 49 49 49 41
jobs and the history of work and how we	70 70 70 70 70 67 70 70 67
I ' m making sometimes one penny per day	74 74 74 41 41 41 80 80 49
a handful of auditions a year	50 51 50 80 53 77
So that is a solid half hour - long introduction	58 58 58 58 58 67 67 67 67 58
for the theater side of your career	64 64 67 67 67 40 41
and how your audition kind of fits into	68 64 64 64 64 67 64 41
off dvd sales or blu - ray sales or video	49 71 71 68 68 68 68 71 68 68
Doe I ' m 45 years old	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
would give me the sides then and there	64 64 67 67 67 67 67 67
step in the process	79 80 44 41
streaming services it ' s going to save	79 43 79 79 79 79 70 70
here in the atlanta area but if you live	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
3000 K because I found that was the best	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
not be a featured role in your auditions	70 70 70 70 70 67 71 71
like eight years to build up	58 59 58 58 61 61
if you book an acting job and you make	67 40 40 40 67 67 67 40 40
acting classes that you could benefit	71 71 71 71 71 71
that tipping point where you can ' t keep	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
work that can back up	40 40 40 71 71
and then we would put the director so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
grout lines and just choose like a white	79 79 79 71 79 79 71 71
yourself to answer these questions I	49 71 68 79 79 79
than if i had bought	71 79 79 79 79
Thursday kind of a toss - up so let ' s just	49 40 49 49 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
have to have all of these sections when	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
course i ' m cheering for you guys	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70
they are not too customized or too	79 79 79 70 79 79 79

But obviously this is not the way to look at it	28 28 28 37 28 37 37 64 46 46 76
world is worn with medical school with	41 40 40 52 52 53 54

agent sent me an email says	49 77 41 41 41 41
and I imagine around the rest of the world as well	49 50 53 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
well the big problem with that two big	41 71 71 68 68 77 77 77
because Muhammad Ali famous boxer	49 49 49 49 49
and so i would say that that mastermind	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
my acting range yeah yeah like out for a	58 58 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
have to know if you ' re good at acting if	70 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 70 61 58
sat in the computer room the five six of us	51 51 51 24 51 51 51 0 0 0
as a police officer it ' s harder for them	79 79 79 49 40 40 40 49 19 19
find the property and make sure that the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
perform in front of an audience	41 49 49 50 41 50
if I want to	33 33 0 33
all right that was a step	71 71 71 71 71 41
this role but then ultimately i didn	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
recovered a little bit more now I can	49 49 49 49 49 40 50 40
or fatigue or overall exhaustion that	40 40 40 40 40 40
then growing a YouTube channel	43 43 52 52 52

but then we can sell infinite copies of	76 76 76 76 76 76 73 76
you you know you haven ' t given it enough	37 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46
buying it five days later i went back to	41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
because you ' re thinking about investing	32 31 31 31 40 40 40
in exchange for discounted classes you	80 80 80 80 80 41
move to this city	79 79 79 79
don ' t regret that at all i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that but whenever I see the crew getting	50 49 73 73 73 73 73 73
what ' s up my fellow actors welcome to	0 0 0 0 49 41 71 71 71
And that ' s actually quite hard to do	52 43 43 43 43 52 52 52 52
unpaid or	50 49
out to tenants	40 40 40
they gave me two or three different days	40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41
question because the truth is an agent	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
but i just want to give you one example	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
with head shots the next thing that	80 71 81 0 0 -149 -119
in the united states you are either a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the most kind of satisfaction when you do it	44 44 71 76 44 44 71 49 49
And so you need sponsorship or a brand deal	41 41 40 67 67 49 49 49 11
create an example acting resume	76 76 79 76 73
to earn the money to buy the thing and	0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 49
so that ' s why i say step nine here is	71 70 70 70 67 40 40 40 40 67 68
confidence that you ' re the right person	71 68 68 68 68 68 68 71
completely false	79 79
it ' s a really big time commitment and it	46 46 46 37 37 37 37 19 23 23
of making money on the internet now 13	31 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
simple but as you saw I was smiling	68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68
actual audition for a commercial	0 0 0 0 0
that your business bought you	51 51 51 51 51
going to be stronger	49 40 41 41
have to pay annual dues annual base dues	76 70 70 79 68 41 68 40
there wasn ' t the pressure	79 79 79 79 79 79
jumpstart their career alright until	67 67 67 67 40
important whether it ' s you know from	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
twelve years having agreed within your	71 71 71 71 71 71
and all these meeting lists and all these societies	76 76 79 79 79 49 49 49 49
becoming a professional actor requires	71 71 70 71 41
into in my business that truly has	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
now self tapes are becoming much more	49 49 49 80 76 71 71
you can ask your teacher or other	79 79 79 79 80 80 71
to productivity and fulfillment	73 76 76 76
industry standard is to only write	0 0 0 0 0 0
the S & amp ; P 500 has had	55 55 55 55 55 55 55 58 58
lines all memorized you ' ve made some	76 79 79 71 71 71 71 49
Now I can ' t be bothered	61 61 61 61 61 61 62
not living there you ' ll probably have to	40 40 31 31 31 31 40 31 31
unexpected repairs for example what if	40 70 61 58 31 31
huge benefit to being in these	76 76 76 76 76 76
and insecurity going into university about making friends	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
to get a thousand downloads per month	63 63 63 63 63 59 67
We ' re gonna give that a four out of five stars	52 52 52 70 70 67 67 67 70 71 71 49
these deals they are	53 40 40 40
the lenders only look at the credit	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And that is a more accurate idea	58 61 58 67 40 40 40
well if it ' s gonna go up or not and how	20 21 21 21 21 21 21 10 19 79 79 79
all celebrate the audition itself and	49 19 79 79 79 76
And it didn ' t really require any like special knowledge	49 49 41 41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49
club series where we distill and discuss	61 61 70 71 70 70 70
so many kind of online courses that seem	49 49 49 49 49 76 21 1
about is where is your tipping point	79 19 0 0 0 0 0
But I ' ve sort of ingrained it into my life	51 41 41 41 41 41 70 79 70 67 67
however the good news is that i	41 41 41 41 41 77 77
allows you to take	40 40 43 43
now this window is an 8 by 10 aspect	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
because you can save a lot of money the	52 70 70 43 70 70 70 70 49
but in in my experience that ' s like	49 49 49 52 79 79 79 79 67
time watching one of my videos	41 71 71 71 71 71
do on the internet wherever you are in	50 50 50 50 49 49 49 49
And so in a way I ' m getting this 50 , 000 pounds car	80 50 50 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40
- Okay so if you spend any amount of time on YouTube	37 37 55 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67
be quite hard to find someone like that	70 61 70 79 70 79 79 79
I ' ve worked on then I ' ve created a free	41 41 41 41 41 49 79 79 79 79 79 79
for your exams effectively and efficiently	79 79 79 79 79 79
more money does not lead to more	40 46 76 67 70 70 71
the molding and the trims choose maybe a	77 78 74 74 74 79 79 79
want to do that	79 79 79 79
can and a paintbrush or any other	31 40 43 40 40 52 79
and all these different factors	67 67 67 67 64
accents and don ' t forget audition	49 70 70 70 70 70 70
pay full price for clothing i just don	79 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
every business needs a marketing plan	0 0 0 0 0 71
right so for this particular role they	49 49 49 52 79 77 80
videos either directly to the casting	79 79 64 67 73 64
actually grow your business you want	79 70 70 70 49 49
awesome homes that you probably would	67 67 67 67 67 67
example in palo alto where i was raised	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
them and then dm them all the time about	76 76 76 79 77 77 77 50 50
throughout your entire body and	41 41 41 41 50
absolutely have to learn how to code but	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
so if this is something that you	68 79 79 79 79 79 79
for instance	40 49
they will range between probably a	71 71 80 79 52 49
or what happens if there are any	58 31 40 49 76 76 49
potential money that can be made	67 71 71 71 71 71
the agent now passing that information	40 67 70 70 70 67
example is the show i ' m currently	80 76 76 79 79 79 79 79

more likely to call you in for more	64 77 77 68 67 67 67 67
hard and that you ' re using your costume	79 79 79 77 77 77 76 76 79
This is the stuff that Tim Ferris	58 58 58 58 67 58 58

starbucks and dropping five dollars on a	70 71 52 79 79 52 52
but the reality is that it ' s going to be	71 71 71 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
picture out there	71 68 68
advice that you ' re gonna hear from	52 79 79 79 79 79 70 50
colleagues or a fancy watch that you	41 41 41 38 1 1 1
advantage of those classes that are	79 77 68 71 68 67

on mastering your craft because that will carry you	68 71 71 71 71 71 79 71 71
learning investing in our skills and a	70 49 49 79 70 43 52
And so I tried doing like a few dozens of patients	64 68 68 68 67 64 64 55 55 58 59
or you are non - union in which case you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to put first you take a risk and fraud	71 71 71 40 41 41 71 67 71
have that expense and i think it really	70 70 70 46 46 40 73 64
something even easier than that instead	79 79 79 70 76 73
great benefits without stressing	49 49 49 49
you can get $ 7 in affiliate commission just for that thing	55 58 58 55 55 55 58 58 76 49 71 49
some of you	50 50 50
my commercial experience my commercial	40 40 46 73 73

an accelerated depreciation on that	13 43 61 43 40
happiness those are the things that lead	79 52 52 52 52 52 52
and I ' m listening to something on Audible or whatever	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
the kitchen and the living room if	79 79 79 70 79 79 79
of me in person or virtually you know	50 50 50 49 41 41 41 50
Even if you put your money in a savings account	50 51 54 54 53 52 79 70 40 40
At other times they ' re more annoying	49 41 41 40 40 40 40 67
foods you know so the less minimally or	41 41 41 41 41 41 50 41
can cash flow the housing prices are	31 31 31 31 28 28 28
current resume you can see the standard	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and I first came across it	67 67 67 67 67 67
just learning how to do everything i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the sort of expertise that then means	76 76 76 76 76 76 76
That I don ' t think that is a risk	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
health and fitness into that type of	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
All of these three conditions are met	79 71 71 79 76 49 41
then uploads it to casting this is	64 41 68 68 49 49 49
in today ' s video we ' re talking about 10	49 40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41 71 49
industry too	71 68
11 is not too young	49 49 79 79 79
so what is sag - aftra sag - aftra is a	50 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
to show them your work show them your	79 79 79 79 52 52 52 79
and any personal use is insignificant or incidental	51 51 47 51 78 54 51 51
ethnicities as well so i auditioned for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
this video well in a few seconds I	71 71 71 76 41 71 79 80
ever read so i will put a link to self	70 40 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
my posture is really really crap	79 79 79 79 79 79
So don ' t prioritize work	76 77 77 77 77 76
audition time	77 77
to discuss what i will be wearing for	49 49 43 43 43 70 70 40
set one day	0 0 0
your equity in the home so it	79 79 71 79 79 79 71
it ' s a lot more flexible than having to	40 40 40 10 40 40 67 40 40 40
go smoothly there are so many free	79 79 70 79 79 79 79
situation where we go in person and	64 64 67 70 67 49 49
or when you read I don ' t know " The 4 - Hour Work Week "	79 79 79 79 80 52 52 52 52 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
could make your own course for complete	0 73 76 73 76 19 19
actor I booked about 10 percent of my	41 41 41 71 71 71 80 71
for company training videos and	68 68 68 71 71
money saved up beyond that actual	79 79 79 79 79 79
you can basically build anything from a simple website	67 68 68 67 67 67 68 71 71
any Facebook groups for actors and	68 71 71 70 70 71
where your character starts getting a lot more powerful	11 70 70 67 64 65 64 65 65
little bit um so as my business has	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
So in light of all of that this is the ultimate guide	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 71 52 52
say you ' re living in a in a place where	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71 71
make a demo reel with	71 71 71 53 50
the day before or the days prior because	20 23 23 23 23 23 20 20
in order to support their acting career	52 52 52 52 52 52 52
talk about the difference between	71 71 71 68 68
bathroom and kitchen and all that stuff	70 76 70 79 79 79 79
the acting teacher and the students	71 71 71 71 71 71
so similarly if you want your job to be	50 50 50 50 80 50 50 80 50
" This can be write off day	76 76 50 50 50 49 49

start thinking about how you ' re going to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
about this story was that remember that	40 49 41 41 41 50 41

during this quarantine time if you can	49 49 49 49 40 40 41
all kind of adds up to future residual	70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

caught up on the education they spend a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 62
And this would very quickly compound so that	53 53 79 79 52 52 52 26
flow and you can also have massive tax	31 31 31 40 40 37 40 31
does it have to be an hour two hours or	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 49
never ever pay an agent an upfront fee	71 79 71 71 71 71 71 71
in fact I ' m actually helping a family	52 52 52 52 52 79 79 79 70
work hard	71 71
So don ' t worry so much	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
take hold of some questions will i break	49 49 49 70 70 70 70 68
open just for agents with their clients	79 79 79 79 79 73 79
bring headshots to auditions always all	1 1 1 1 76 67
to type all right	0 0 0 0
which is revenue per mille	58 58 58 58 58
of the memories that you recorded	79 76 80 79 79 79
you want to be seen as a professional	49 49 79 79 49 49 68 71
And therefore you make money through dividends	71 79 70 71 71 71 61
industry who ' s watching your audition	79 79 79 79 80 79 79
and that has turned out to be a really	49 49 79 79 71 71 71 71 71
now that ' s going to be up to you whether	49 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
some spare cash to go on holiday with	61 61 61 61 70 70 67 67
long - term rentals buying multi - units and	44 44 44 44 40 71 71 71 44
because it ' s a video about making money online	67 67 67 67 68 68 58 58 67 67
actors let ' s talk about saving some time	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
how to get an agent for acting	70 70 71 70 70 67 77
that night so that you can be on set	67 64 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
happening well your body is using itself	49 49 46 46 49 46 46
every single role that needs to be cast	70 70 70 67 70 70 70 70
So you create it once and then you can sell it	49 49 76 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 58
amount of time you ' re putting it now if	53 53 26 26 26 26 26 53 53 53
put a link to it down in the description	76 76 76 76 79 71 71 71 71
starting out in their career they ' re so	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 49
templates i created a brand and added it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
there are so many loan programs out	70 43 79 79 79 79 71
posts sharing your favorite productivity	0 0 1 1 0
uh they end up changing things around	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
online students over the past year	79 79 79 79 79 79
Because it ' s just what you ' ve known	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of like a few weeks	0 0 0 0 0
you go to your next audition so that you	73 76 76 76 79 79 79 49 40
go into a clothing store is	68 68 68 68 41 40
And it ' s like the government thinks	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51
again that ' s what they really want to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
So I suspect people are gonna be less keen	67 41 49 40 40 40 49 50 40
what you study and how you study	40 40 40 49 49 49 49
union to make sure the sets are safe	68 50 50 50 50 50 71 71
this video helpful	71 71 31
amazing house hacking can be and take	70 70 79 70 79 80 80
you ' re only qualified for about like	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
let ' s say you make an iOS game or	46 46 46 19 19 19 19 19 19 0
actually my favorite it ' s the way that I	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 43 49 49
second memorization technique is to	40 71 71 71 41
designer I then moved towards selling	1 1 58 61 61 61
websites submit your headshot	71 70 70 70
my suggestion	70 70
acting classes when they are starting	80 80 79 79 79 79
always seems to be the better actors on	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that ' s when you should get your license	70 70 70 70 70 70 79 79 79
question is asked and what you should	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
is because of capital gains tax	79 70 79 79 79 79
commercial property	79 79
So for example let ' s say you bought 10 shares in Apple	49 79 70 61 61 61 61 70 70 70 70 70 79
and new roles and you know it was one of	32 32 32 32 30 30 30 30 30 30
what i recommend for most people is just	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
ton of questions hopefully you ' ve taken	70 79 70 70 79 79 79 79
question I remember the first time I was	71 71 71 49 49 49 71 71
we ' re never worried about our productivity	31 31 31 32 32 0 0 0
mentioned in last week ' s video i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
then let ' s move on to these next nine	70 70 70 70 67 67 67 67 71 71
at a conference in Singapore	49 49 46 52 52
brain you ' re only going to make as much	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It ' s just that they just do the mundane repeatedly	76 76 76 76 76 76 73 73 76 76 67
in full costume for an audition hey like	80 79 79 79 79 79 49 79
it shows the relationship between the	1 1 1 4 4 13
and people really like it and it ' ll help you get tips	41 41 41 41 20 22 22 22 22 0 0 0 0
so this is a great way to gain	71 71 71 71 41 71 71 52
to rent out i think this is the goal	41 41 41 41 40 40 52 52 49
truth is	67 67
and that ' s gonna be split evenly	70 79 79 79 79 70 70 67
available during the shoot dates for the	70 71 71 71 71 71 68
it ' s actually quite easy to maintain	76 76 76 80 79 79 79 52
returns and to be extra safe use a	70 79 79 79 79 70 62 1
get signed by a talent agency talent	71 71 71 71 71 71 79
into this career but oftentimes most	71 71 40 40 80 80
to consider is not spending enough money	70 79 76 76 79 79 79
then again depending on your circumstances	58 58 58 67 49 49
and we have lots of stuff going on	58 58 58 58 58 61 61 58
could have made because especially when	79 79 79 79 79 79
as you are in the process there ' s no way	32 32 32 32 40 52 41 41 41 41 41
treated as an employee of your own s	31 31 31 31 28 31 31 31
Point number five try and be a connector	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
reputation this this audience of people	76 67 28 28 28 19
And I promise we ' re gonna get to that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
doubt i could have done what i ' ve been	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
my acting career entirely at a young age	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
but i am saying just look for these	40 40 40 41 41 44 44 61
And so we worked over the summer of 2015	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
better chance of being cast if you don	50 50 50 77 77 77 77 76
they are good agents most of them	49 49 49 49 49 46 46
you because you are standing out from	80 80 80 80 80 80 80
and microphones and tripods and editing	40 41 49 68 50 41
you ' re only putting down	10 10 10 19 19 19
that would be ridiculous wouldn ' t it so	79 49 79 79 79 79 79 67 67
and there are all sorts of benefits	70 67 70 70 70 70 70
robinson who after we did this episode	79 79 79 53 80 80 41
casting networks	80 77
but i still do think that it ' s very	79 79 80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
part of it we already talked about the	37 37 40 40 40 40 40 40
not just any college a very selective	53 71 71 71 71 71 71
just never bought it but then I recently	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
director and if your headshot does not	71 68 68 68 71 71 71
but you may need to spend some money in	40 40 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
this you can get a lot of really great	19 19 19 19 19 46 46 41 41
commercial at all	71 41 41
but guess what this is the cost of doing	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 80 76
is only one piece of the puzzle it ' s an	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
work with me because i do not do	79 79 71 80 80 80 80 80

between 24 and 48 hours to prepare for	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
i mean a city or a state where there is	50 50 50 50 50 50 49 79 49 50
take 10 - 15 minutes maybe 30 minutes I	49 49 49 49 49 50 49 46 50
self - study so you have to be like really	71 71 71 70 79 79 79 70 71 70
this is because of compounding	76 76 70 79 70
guys to	22 49
it ' s like if you buy a house as an investment	76 76 76 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
seconds long and are usually selling a	70 70 70 70 70 71 70
And there ' s broadly two ways of answering this question	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they have to be doing a real service for	37 40 40 40 40 31 40 40 40
but it really adds up so while it is	49 79 79 79 79 79 79 43 79
rapper ' s receipt has made a huge	50 50 50 41 41 50 51 10
ahead and use props if it helps you	49 49 49 49 49 67 67 67
but you ' ve also made money off of the capital gains	58 58 58 58 58 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
And so your CPM rates are gonna be higher	50 50 50 50 50 73 64 76 76
doing similar things to you and who	79 79 79 79 79 79 49
they ' re going to need to make movies	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 40 50
outside of class on the weekends and	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
but you probably don ' t have to think	68 70 52 52 52 52 52 53 80
breakdown i then send the headshot	80 50 50 41 71 71
you ' re gonna need it and it can be a	52 52 52 49 49 76 76 76 79 79 79

original question of was was sitting	41 40 49 49 49 40

talking more about spending money and	61 61 62 79 79 61

pay you for that online education you	41 25 25 70 70 79 52

the length of their videos to make it more than 10 minutes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 67 67
the more the flywheel gathers momentum	25 52 52 52 52 52

When we think of fun we often think that there ' s just	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
the purchase price down there are lots	67 40 40 40 40 40 40

i tell them to start looking at	31 31 31 31 31 31 31
that would make you round about $ 100 a month	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 40 49
ever auditioning for it	40 40 40 40
baseball or I was traveling for	49 49 46 46 46 49
you have a decent chance but if there	49 50 50 50 50 53 80 41
obviously you can ' t go hunting for those	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 0
seven hundred dollars don ' t that scare	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
or through my headphones it makes the work more fun	0 0 0 0 79 79 79 79 79 79
from other sources that video	41 41 41 41 41
is that it kind of glorifies the hustle	76 76 76 76 76 76 67 68
it ' s gonna have a physiological effect	49 49 49 49 46 46 46 46
properties that need a little bit of	40 40 40 40 40 40 67
important the main reason for this is	77 41 40 40 40 40 40
considerations when you ' re deciding to	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
stuff you build an audience by giving	81 81 81 81 81 81 80
Point number 13 : high leverage housekeeping	49 67 70 70 71 67 70
you do have those popcorn ceilings that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
know you ' re spending more money and and	79 79 79 79 79 52 79 79 79
situation and someone who was more	32 29 29 30 30 30
unfortunately they	49 71
the 12 steps every actor needs to take	49 80 71 71 71 71 41 41

it it ' s definitely the safer way it	76 49 49 49 76 76 76 49 76
to inflate above 10 minutes	49 49 40 40 37
So it ' s not hard creating one	59 67 67 67 76 49 49 49
and it doesn ' t have to be long it only	77 77 77 77 77 41 41 41 71 71 71
over a hundred working days and built up an audience	52 79 79 76 52 77 68 58 61 55

sag - aftra joining the union sag - aftra is	67 67 67 67 67 67 40 40 40 70
different so if you ' re not 18 years old	79 79 70 40 40 40 79 79 79 79

So if you wanna make $ 100 a month	71 71 71 80 53 50 50 49 79
the way to be productive is to have a single daily highlight	79 70 73 46 49 67 76 76 79 79 70 67
there is life going on around us there are distractions	49 40 71 71 71 71 79 79 79 79

This is fine	80 53 80
auditioning now if you ' re interested in	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71

unless it ' s an emergency right so you	76 79 79 79 79 79 52 76 79
that means if you have both an agent and	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67

channel to get more videos on acting	80 71 71 71 71 71 79
this video or even more detailed videos	40 41 31 40 40 31 28
the casting directors and producers made	34 34 34 31 34 31
audition on one hand and the world	67 67 67 70 71 71 71
some kind of money through this passive income stuff	52 79 79 59 40 49 49 49 49
the teams that are competing	41 49 50 41 41
it ' s not just about getting the agent	44 44 44 44 41 41 40 40 40
take a look see what you can cut out and	70 70 70 70 79 79 70 49 79 70
their income satisfies the debt to	70 70 70 43 61 71
right for me my faith is really	70 43 43 40 70 70 70
good - looking people do get more opportunities in this	41 41 41 49 49 49 41 41 41 41
made lightly or quickly	43 40 68 71
And so they would all start off as red	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
And that ' s a different sort of fun	67 67 67 67 73 76 64 73 76
And then that fund would have a fund manager	49 40 70 70 70 76 52 49 49
or something like that	49 49 79 67
i ' m not saying to take advantage of that	0 0 0 0 79 70 70 79 40 40
Thanks for watching and I ' ll see you in the next video	40 40 40 40 41 41 41 50 49 49 49 49 40
to give them a second round of auditions	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
back to one simply means that we	79 79 79 70 70 70 70
the local economy price the rent ratios	31 31 31 31 58 58 58
cheat sheet	71 71
and for me	79 79 79
now let ' s talk about a couple things that you can do to avoid making that	71 71 71 71 68 68 68 68 68 68 71 71 71 80 80 71 71
and I ' ve actually just released my new online class	54 81 81 81 71 71 44 44 44 44 44
character never changed	79 79 52
bed head on the pillow and I will read	79 79 79 79 79 76 76 76 76
vacation whenever you want you can	11 11 11 11 11 11
gotten discounted classes or even free	77 77 53 77 68 68
wagon maybe I just do the warm - up or	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
television commercials	71 41
graduated so i don ' t necessarily have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you are no longer allowed to work on	67 70 67 67 70 43 40 50
to twenty five six feet tall like really	40 40 40 49 49 40 49 40
to start owning real estate and building	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
20 for long - term capital gains this	19 19 20 20 20 19 19 20
sound like they are films made by	49 49 40 40 40 40 49
you ' re just getting started now one	79 79 79 79 79 68 68 68
early as you can is just super super	31 31 31 31 40 40 40 41
not in the sense because you don ' t have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
director then takes that script	70 70 70 70 40
important for example it determines who	80 40 44 40 41 40
And I was just like " Oh Molly I need to film a video	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 25 25 25 52 52 52 52
And then it gives you a problem in which	52 52 79 70 68 68 67 67 71
make more than $ 100 , 000 per sponsored video	49 49 49 40 40 40 40 40 49 49
going to count as a residential property	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
be looking for someone who has a	49 76 79 49 49 67 71
days so you definitely don ' t have to go	53 80 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53
business right you could hire them to	79 40 31 31 31 31 31
decided that I wanted to be a super nerd	49 49 49 52 79 79 79 79 76
looking for homes this is the boring	40 31 40 40 40 40 40
instance every year thousands and	71 67 67 67 67
you ' re actually only gonna get $ 6 . 50 off that amount	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
job you ' ll like change the shoot dates	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
show and you are no longer allowed to	77 77 50 67 40 40 40 40
stress and anxiety and worry	43 43 80 52 80
starbucks can seem like it ' s a lot more	40 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
financials your cash reserves all that	79 79 70 70 79 70
where they hired an actor from a	76 73 73 76 76 76 73
you would need around 1 , 000 downloads per episode	50 49 49 22 19 19 19 76 67 67
lightly and it should not be made on a	41 41 41 41 41 41 49 49 76
as you go through the video	68 68 67 67 67 67
most acting classes are not quite that	79 79 71 70 71 41 41
maybe between 5 and 10 hours of your	49 40 40 49 49 49 40 40
this is rolled into the value of the	70 61 61 61 70 76 80 80
lot to me because you know internally	49 50 50 50 50 50 50
she started five months ago	63 63 63 63 63
was a little caught off guard by it and	40 41 41 71 71 71 71 68 68
just really crazy to see that they can	79 79 71 71 71 71 71 71
things that you are working through and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
all of these things are sacrifices that	41 41 41 41 41 41 71
and i didn ' t book any of those initial	77 76 79 79 79 76 79 79 76 79
youtube video	71 41
so you may have to do your own research	49 76 68 68 68 41 41 41 68
body in my brain absorb all of this the	41 49 41 41 41 40 40 40 67
consider you for other roles in the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in individual stocks is it ' s kind of risky	61 34 70 67 67 67 67 70 70 49
have a lot of things automated you have	79 79 79 79 79 80 79 79
because the longterm difference between 0 . 1 % fees	79 79 70 31 31 70 70 70 70 71
before you shell out the money for that	77 70 71 67 67 70 79 79
but i promise it ' s completely worth it	79 70 71 41 41 41 79 79 79
to mars	37 37
more strength and resiliency so we do a	50 50 40 40 40 40 40 40
and get us to this magical Nirvana of like you know	71 53 53 53 53 80 80 80 80 53 50
it and i knew that this was all part of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
may need to think about is whether or	71 71 71 71 71 71 67 67
after only doing it for a couple years	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
transactions are complicated as hell so	67 70 79 79 70 79
really appreciate	50 50
headshots are done	67 68 50
rules as you ' ll ever find in your acting	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 70 70 70
it doesn ' t matter	70 70 70 70 70
a manager	67 67

builds on itself and is unstoppable	70 70 70 76 67 67
is totally fine because most phones have	49 49 49 40 40 40 40

right at the start	71 71 71 71
Thanks to something called inflation ( bubble pops )	64 67 64 67 67 67 67 67 67
then that means in the future they are	68 68 67 67 67 67 67 67
have been totally worth it and if you	79 79 80 79 79 80 79 79

demo reel right what is it used for well	41 71 50 49 49 49 52 41 41
and then two months later you ' re stuck	79 52 80 80 79 52 52 52 79
expensive it depends on what type of	79 79 79 49 49 79 79

the rule is that it has to be wholly	79 79 79 79 76 76 76 76 40

they got this from your statement to the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
make us look like amateurs remember that	49 71 70 70 70 49 49
ways to gain experience and	50 71 71 70 70
but when when we see award	40 49 52 49 79 79
that means that every year we ' d be making 10	52 70 62 62 70 70 70 70 70 70 52
help with just the camera or anything or	49 49 49 49 50 50 40 43
it on to the casting directors	64 64 64 64 64 41
starting to book speaking roles then you	64 64 64 67 71 70 67
doesn ' t sign you and the reason is	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
similarly thousands and thousands of	70 70 70 70 67
makes a roundabout $ 12 , 000 a month	62 67 76 49 49 49 49 49 41
once a year but here ' s a situation where	49 49 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
want to make sure that it ' s a good deal	79 79 79 50 23 23 23 23 41 41 41
either i ' ve worked on plenty of	71 68 68 68 79 79 79 79
cheating to the camera kind of goes hand	70 70 79 70 70 70 70 70
is one help you with and hold on good if	71 71 41 79 79 79 77 77 77 77
" but I can ' t be assed	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
life you ' ll want to find out what the	79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79 79 79
( light music )	70 70 70 70
doing the boring fundamentals repeatedly	40 67 64 37 67
Whereas I am like really falling behind	71 70 71 79 79 70 79
make sure that you ' re ready to give up	70 43 43 43 43 43 53 80 53 53
of the S & amp ; P 500	80 51 77 77 77 77 77 70
this is not going to provide exposure	49 49 40 40 49 79 79
scale that was when I was probably my	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
my sizes and she said no the audition	49 49 49 68 71 71 70 73
I ' m glad that it happened to me as	32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 41
So for me when I started my YouTube channel in June 2017	70 70 70 70 71 71 71 68 68 68 68 68
with dialogue	40 40
it didn ' t really occur to me how	46 46 46 46 46 46 41 50 50
below and now that you ' ve created a demo	76 49 40 40 41 41 41 41 40 40
mock audition for the casting director	71 71 80 80 71 80
investment that is hard to learn and get	49 49 40 40 40 49 49 49
and that is to maybe go to a photography	70 70 70 70 70 71 49 19 49
to tax you on up to 250 000	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
move out of frame hey if you ' re getting	40 31 31 67 80 80 71 71 71 71

and through the platform they could do	0 0 41 40 40 40 40
and then you put them up on youtube or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
big hollywood movies so today i want to	49 41 41 41 41 49 49 49
while the person reading the opposite lines usually stand next to the camera	79 49 71 71 71 71 71 71 68 67 64 41 71
a different story	68 71 41

as a side hustle while working a	79 79 79 79 79 52 52
you ' re gonna have to be uploading these	40 40 40 40 40 40 71 71 79

when a customer orders that watch we	11 11 0 0 0 0 0
now i did this with my first	31 40 40 67 49 49 49
The fees for those are really low	79 70 70 52 71 71 71

thinking that your best acting is	41 41 41 41 41 41
that ' s why i encourage you to get advice	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 53 53

costs in the first couple years as an	41 41 71 71 71 49 76 41
money they ' re willing to lend you it	44 44 44 44 44 41 41 41 40
cost some money in order to upload	40 43 70 67 67 67 67
you haven ' t heard of him	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
of going through the motions and just	40 40 40 50 41 50 49
eligible for a solo 401k now when you	31 31 31 31 31 40 49 49
as well this is important because as you	58 44 41 41 41 41 41 41
" but I said don ' t quit	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
what can you do to stand out from the	80 80 80 80 80 77 77 77 77
casting platforms are actors access and	71 77 71 21 21 21
as much as they want to so now let	80 80 80 80 80 68 68 71 71
crisis and now listen here y ' all I can	79 76 58 76 79 58 58 58 31 58
november 6 the day that we shot the	41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
did some study questions to prepare	49 40 67 67 67 40
That was like 1500 quid a month	32 32 32 32 32 32 32
because this counts as a business expense	19 52 52 71 71 49 49
is just that the teaching style is a bit	79 79 70 70 79 79 79 70 79
very different and then you have the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
and how hard it is to maintain	41 49 41 41 41 40 40
where you live let ' s say you buy a home	79 79 79 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 11
union laws the union laws that apply to	77 71 68 68 77 77 77 77
let me see oh no it was a week later a	41 41 50 50 50 14 41 41 41 41 41
and it just doesn ' t work that way it	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
ratio or else when we print we	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
so if you were in a web series that you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just don ' t have the time so that ' s why	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 77
hoops you could be just you could be	73 73 73 64 64 64 64 64
creating courses and launching them in	79 79 79 79 79 79
score of the person with the lower	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
allow you to sign up for an exam date	40 49 40 40 49 41 40 40 40
and you want the fees to be as low as possible	24 24 78 78 51 50 50 49 76 70 79
set the chart down and then	79 79 79 79 79 79
the next video thanks so much for	22 22 13 31 31 31 31
you know it was a whole thing in my my	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50 41
because that is where	49 41 50 50
all the way across the country to	76 76 49 41 71 71 41
think that llcs	40 40 40
investing even buying your own home	71 40 40 32 32 32
we ' re human we make mistakes and	41 41 41 41 49 49 49 67
going to make things work on all	49 49 49 49 41 41 41
but if you don ' t then do plan it out	40 40 70 43 43 43 67 43 40 40 58
getting your utilities cut off but it	61 61 70 70 43 70 70
the other option would be to go to a	71 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 68
mints which is one that i use and	70 70 70 71 71 70 70 70
again the scheduling being kind of the	41 41 41 41 40 40 40
recommend that if you ' re going to do	77 76 76 67 67 67 67 67 67
There are two ways you ' re making money from it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 71
buying enough things you can make a load	0 76 73 73 73 73 73 73
beginners on how to edit videos on Final	19 19 49 49 49 50 23 20
megabytes which are very manageable to	80 80 80 80 79 79
these types of practice questions you	49 49 22 49 40 41
so you want to know how to become an	71 79 79 79 79 49 49 71 71
and it ' s gonna get rid of those	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
right so that that ' s awesome so again	47 37 40 46 46 46 46 46 47
doing things that contribute a bit to the world	49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41
recommend jumping into real estate as	79 79 79 79 79 79
or if a streaming service uh picks up	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to this point of financial independence	79 79 71 70 70 70
you ' re investing for the longterm	49 49 49 22 49 70 40
ever get yourself take so much audition	70 71 49 49 79 79 79
five percent	31 31
hours to pittsburgh i did my audition	36 45 44 71 44 44 44
audition for a movie especially	71 71 71 71 49
you have the finances to do it you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
just more difficult right and and what	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
friends and through your family as long	31 40 40 40 40 40 40
have the gist of it and you think you	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40

see you i like to think about auditions	79 76 76 79 79 79 79 79
whole other conversation	71 71 79

one month for them to actually receive	40 40 40 40 40 49 49
you are an actor as well let ' s let ' s	20 20 20 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
recommend finding a brokerage that	70 70 70 70 70
But the main thing I take away from this is that	76 76 76 76 76 76 79 79 79 76 76
a class for free	73 76 76 76
they are an absolute scam they are not a	41 41 41 52 49 49 49 41 41

you have to do dust pose the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
nine little panels and i just thought it	49 49 41 40 37 10 10 10
they might seem quite small at five	52 70 70 31 62 62 62
got a call back for that role	32 32 32 32 32 70 80
which is where it ' s suffering in the present	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49 49 40
it like people are expecting you to sell	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the very first exercise in the meisner	50 50 50 50 49 49 49
student film or a web series and you	50 50 50 50 50 77 41 41
very very rarely will i have more than	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
career is not going anywhere	79 79 79 79 79
what show they were auditioning for they	40 40 40 40 40 40 49
like brand deals and like selling merch	63 58 58 58 40 40 40
no hard feelings it	49 49 49 49
makes it feel like your money is not	40 40 40 49 41 41 40 40
But then at some point	28 28 28 28 28
invested it and that ' s a very	79 79 79 70 70 70 43 40
obviously that ' s good you just get to	31 31 31 31 32 71 41 41 31
all right	76 79
you ' re given a set of circumstances and	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
mcdonald ' s receipt	71 71 71 71
pounds ago I was overweight on the BMI	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
for the last three years	70 61 61 61 70
and recognize that while that ' s all very good	77 77 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
photos with just their phone right	71 71 71 80 80 76
until i got another email from my agent	68 41 41 71 71 71 71 71
and then go onto set and be able to	41 50 41 41 41 49 50 50 50
very small percentage gets signed and	68 67 71 70 70 67
okay until next time keep practicing	71 49 49 49 41 41
and they hire actors as well so this is	70 71 71 71 71 49 49 49 76
platforms oh and if you remember in my	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40
And now it ' s completely changed my life	52 70 70 70 70 79 79 79 76
on actors who have theater experience	49 40 41 41 41 41
career you are most likely not getting	71 67 67 40 40 67 64
this might take months or maybe even	40 40 44 53 53 53 53
from it as well	79 79 79 79
this industry and this profession as an	49 49 40 67 40 70 70
but because I ' m the closest one to him	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
everything like that	71 71 49
i ' ll put it this way so when you ' re a	41 41 41 41 41 71 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
really consider um the first biggest	79 52 79 52 80 79
on it and that	80 41 41 79
and if i had let her doubts stop me if i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
people involved in it are in it to make	71 71 71 71 71 79 49 49 49
in some sort of sports or	0 0 0 0 0 0
get excited to talk about her so you	49 70 71 71 71 71 41 41
prices and it ' s extremely convenient	79 70 70 70 70 79 79
i have not seen a single situation where	79 79 71 70 70 67 67 67
yes the process is probably going to	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
character and then she asked me do you	71 41 41 41 71 71 71 71
whole process now a lot of people get	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
professionals will go to to check out	49 49 49 49 40 50 53

gonna explain exactly how all of that	68 68 71 71 71 71 71
mortgages they actually don ' t offer any	79 79 79 70 70 70 61 61
starting out we have no idea if	70 70 61 70 79 79 79
my name is Kurt you hey if you haven	41 40 40 41 41 41 23 22 26
is way too high we ' ll start with three	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
agents are trying to represent a diverse	80 80 52 49 71 71 71
to create a demo reel once you get to	44 37 37 37 37 40 41 41 68
with a partner with a scene partner	37 37 37 40 40 40 37
negotiate you have to work on repairs	41 40 40 41 41 41 40
in these types of projects the more	80 80 50 71 71 49 49
first time you were asked tell me about	68 68 68 71 71 71 71 71
and the reason why i say that it was an	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
it is a very very competitive industry	77 77 80 80 80 80 80
I used to fall into this trap you see when I first started auditioning	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 79 49 41 71 71 71 71
absolutely have to know before getting a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
monologues even in the classroom look i	68 50 50 50 41 41 49
the websites Fiverr or upwork and browse	0 0 0 0 0 4 5
there are probably opportunities to act	68 68 71 71 79 79
get inspire youtube home an D is one of	64 68 68 68 41 71 71 71 71
distribution this means you skip out on	31 31 34 43 43 43 43
and paying a lot of money	79 79 79 79 79 79
in passive income from a podcast	70 52 79 52 52 52
a bunch of monologues when um when i	50 50 50 80 49 49 49 76
All right so when I say passive income	63 59 58 19 0 0 0 0
house is going to be a rental because	79 79 79 52 52 52 79 79
and then divide that by the total square	31 1 28 1 1 31 31 31

and suddenly you can just kind of do all these things	64 67 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
it ' s not to be the best in the world at anything	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 67 67 76 76
what I mean by that is	79 79 79 79 79 49
what your skills are and if i like what	79 79 67 79 49 49 49 40 71
like that you know you can go on	77 77 50 40 40 11 11 11

thirdly she talks a lot about how	0 0 49 76 68 68 70
to you when it really counts further down the line	79 76 73 73 76 79 79 79 79 79

career is quite the roller coaster ride	70 71 49 79 79 70 70
performer now this is a completely	71 32 32 32 32 70
i recommend just have some of these	31 40 49 49 76 76 49
same time now let me pause here for a	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
is because they	41 41 40
need both you need	0 0 0 0
hopefully that makes sense and this	79 79 79 79 79 79
be scared as long as you do it right	31 34 34 61 61 61 61 61 31
property and i ' ve also been brokering	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
thousand dollars but that ' s what it	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77
to determine whether or not you have to	79 70 70 70 70 79 79 79
of about four hours and genuinely was quite fun	51 51 51 51 51 0 0 0 20
we ' re never worried about motivation	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Because again YouTube has so much distribution built in	67 67 67 68 67 67 64 67 64
And so they ' ll watch your stuff and give you a shot	58 40 40 40 40 19 49 49 49 22 49 49 49
difference once you are a	71 40 40 40 67
bumped up to a principal performer it	76 71 44 44 41 71 49
alright so the coolest part about this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the week where you unsubscribe from my	43 80 80 80 43 43 41
agents in a second but there are also	71 71 71 71 49 40 70 70
on all income up to 137	31 40 31 31 31 31
here and I agree with that to an extent	77 77 77 77 77 77 76 76 76
hopefully i would have been cast in a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
do rely on someone else for the majority	49 52 52 79 79 79 79 79
computer science in college	79 79 79 79
the question was	80 79 79
and that happens in the acting world all	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
brother is a seven - time national	40 40 40 40 40 40 41
there is no PMI payments no mortgage	49 71 0 0 0 0 0
while they ' re getting the lights and	37 49 49 49 49 41 71 71
at least in 2020	44 44 44 67
were incredible for me i did an um	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
with money	0 0
five to six thousand dollars before you	76 77 80 76 77 77 79
was able to get an agent in the u . s was	78 78 78 78 78 78 77 77 77 77 77 76
and done it and this is not like doing	79 79 79 79 79 52 52 79 79
the fundamentals of how computer science work	70 67 70 79 70 49 49
but it ' s one of those things that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
with making a commitment to learning a	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
scene and not just the lines now you	40 50 50 50 50 46 49 64
now if you ' re interested in learning	67 67 41 41 41 41 41 41
percentage over the hundreds and	79 77 76 79 76
some reverse lunges or some push ups	50 50 50 50 50 50 50
And the point of the whole year was to kind of focus	49 49 49 49 79 67 67 67 70 70 70 70
should be a professional headshot taken	49 49 49 49 49 49
so what this means for actors is that if	79 49 52 52 52 49 70 70 70
that i have used	71 68 41 52
save you time and actually going out to	71 80 52 52 52 25 25 52
well under $ 100 now if you go to the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your rental income is higher than your	32 31 40 40 40 40 40
your application and	40 40 40
What does that look like	49 49 49 40 41
that booking and percentage better and	80 80 80 80 80 80
that is a one - time fee it ' s not annual	68 68 41 68 68 68 67 67 67 67 67 68

whereby you have your path charted out in front of you	70 70 40 40 37 28 28 28 28 28 40
You can make an app but then getting people	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a career in film and television there	81 71 71 71 71 67 67
my weekly email newsletter I initially have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
might go to a set that has lamb for for	50 41 41 41 41 40 41 40 40 41
working with an agent	50 50 50 50

really want to make sure that your	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
okay so these are all the things that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because it ' s possible i think	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and it it will honestly it will make you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
Whereas estimated revenue of the lifetime	71 41 49 49 49 40
for instance i ' ve done a ton of acting	71 71 71 71 71 71 52 79 79 79
headshot at your auditions well that	79 67 71 71 49 49
or get to slightly higher marks that I forgot to	61 61 40 40 49 49 49 80 81 80
to subscribe to this channel to get more	50 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
and then finally the last column is the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but i really wanted to pinpoint it here	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your imdb if you have imdb pro you can	71 71 71 71 71 49 74 50 50
i didn ' t know shaq was going to be	49 49 49 49 49 49 40 40 49 43
instead we are making and dying we are	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
perfectly their transition from joking	41 41 40 50 50
and so started doing it and I started to	49 49 37 37 37 40 40 46 46
you can also put on special skills	52 79 77 80 70 70 41
And so if this were a normal car	15 51 15 51 51 51 51 51
and help you	40 67 40
yourself I personally got my real estate	41 40 40 40 40 40 40
are you going to want to pay that	70 70 70 70 70 70 67 67
This is the thing to invest in	76 76 76 76 79 79 79
that let ' s say you go into an audition	73 73 73 73 76 76 76 76 76 76
Now how hard is it to get 28 people a month	58 58 58 58 58 59 58 58 58 58 58
because that will give you a free trial to Skillshare	49 49 49 49 50 50 50 50 49 49
the 10 commandments of self taping so	49 49 80 71 71 71 71
so high you ' re going to have all these	49 79 79 79 79 76 79 79 52 25
with friends or just creating a	49 46 49 49 49 49
as a way of returning some of its profit back	58 31 31 31 31 58 67 67 67 67
of those projects were	49 41 41 68
that I found from James Stuber ' s blog	79 49 49 49 49 70 70 70 80
which is just insane	49 50 50 49
you you know started your journey as a	49 49 49 50 49 49 49 49
for example the cabinets the fridge the	52 79 40 40 40 40 40
This is the same principle behind why	49 49 49 53 50 50 80
again gain experience as an actor but	43 43 43 41 40 50 50
but that ' s how much of you the camera	68 68 68 68 71 71 71 71 71 71
but first let me just play a clip of the	71 49 49 49 49 41 41 71 71 71
important things are knowing the market	40 40 40 40 40 49
for free these days there ' s hundreds of	40 40 51 51 41 41 41 50 23
one uh the next major theme in the book	70 70 43 52 52 79 79 79 79
booked the room	67 67 68
parts you might be too short for other	71 43 52 52 79 80 71 71
like I can tell you that " Guys I ' ve just released	49 49 37 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
And what I ' m really annoyed about with myself	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 79
that you ' re offering them	58 58 58 58 58 58
production but I ' m sure you can find	79 79 49 49 49 79 79 79 79
For example in one of my recent videos	64 67 67 67 31 31 37 40
important for an actor	80 77 77 80
saying the opposite lines of a scene	41 41 68 68 68 41 50
interested in just some personal	41 41 41 40 49
I ' m gonna give this a 3 . 5 - star rating	80 80 80 80 40 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
but how hard is it to make $ 100 a month	49 49 49 49 79 49 79 79 79 79 79
i thought i ' d make a follow - up video and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
not just actors but when we when we talk	49 49 40 41 41 41 41 41 41
In fact a lot of podcasts grow by having a YouTube channel	59 59 71 62 62 62 49 22 49 79 79 79
but there are going to be other people	68 68 71 71 71 71 71 68
hey guys in this video we are going over	79 79 70 40 70 70 70 71 21
and yet most of the hours that we spend	52 52 52 79 79 79 79 79 79
you can get thirty minutes five six	50 50 49 46 46 46 46
learning and i hope to see you on set	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 0 0
gain experience to start acting in front	40 40 44 40 40 71 71
to be 8 by 10 well the image on the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 44 44 44
usually if that includes the name of the	49 50 50 50 41 41 41 41
needed renovations then make sure you	79 79 79 79 79 79
real estate but if no one knows that you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
on average about 6 to 12 months for an	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 61 70
films or independent films	49 52 49 43
business expenses so	79 79 79
in real time as I discover them	43 52 52 52 52 79 79
get three	68 68
show them that you can tell an	71 71 71 49 49 49 49
resumes my advice would be to start with	79 49 49 71 71 71 71 71
which is about approaching things sincerely	49 49 49 74 74 73
first - time test takers the passing rate	79 79 79 70 79 70 79 0
impact on your overall portfolio so if	41 71 41 40 70 41 40
even hundreds of thousands of dollars in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
can literally teach yourself anything	1 1 1 1 1
because these online brokers as I said	76 77 77 77 77 76 79
and you should have that money saved up	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 49
thing that i want to mention with	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
And finally the third category	79 79 52 43 43
on money so for example let ' s say you	79 79 79 79 79 52 52 52 52 52
how hard it is to make $ 100 a month from it	40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
resume the person that works at burger	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
makes you look	0 0 0
which is absolutely enormous	64 64 64 73
you need roundabout 1 , 700 minutes of watch time	0 0 61 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
is that your pay is infinitely scalable	79 79 79 79 70 79 79
and doing your best to try and help others	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
want to invest your time in and	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
the comments below	67 68 41
stimulus is or stimuli and then also you	49 50 41 50 50 50 50 47
question price east side and the 500	79 79 79 81 81 51 80
audience so if you can show that you can	41 67 40 40 41 41 40 67 67
I mean anyone can write an ebook	49 49 49 49 49 49 52
that you can do it so in order to pass	41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40 49 49
so multiple investors would invest in the same fund	70 70 80 76 50 80 67 67 70
making a living so that was point number	70 70 79 52 52 49 79 79
and I ' ll be explaining how this whole thing works	71 71 71 71 70 70 67 46 49 41 19
one - on - one support and feedback from you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that so we as actors we need to stop	76 76 41 41 71 71 71 71 71
' cause I don ' t know if this is gonna be good	79 79 79 79 79 79 52 52 52 52 52 79 70
written however as they moved along in	79 79 79 52 52 52 79
further down the line but you ' re gonna wish	77 71 71 79 70 67 67 67 77 76
all of those things that you you can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
estate you know we have all these	40 37 37 37 37 37 40
for our productivity in service of this thing of like	26 53 53 50 20 76 68 41 76 41
got on platforms like YouTube that I can	51 51 51 19 19 20 21 20
just really have to do your due	31 31 31 28 58 58 58
and no training so get your education on	71 70 70 70 41 41 71 71
super easy fix all you have to do is buy	70 70 70 19 19 19 20 21 20 19
that we love then happy days we ' ve got	72 72 72 69 64 64 67 67 67 61
people actually don ' t know that they can	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
are your annual dues so	68 68 68 67 71
is even more complicated as a business	31 31 31 31 31 28 28
submit to an agent actually end up	77 77 77 77 77 80 80
so come up with something unique that	41 71 71 71 71 71 64
how many of them do you know let ' s find	71 71 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 77
you ' re first getting started you are	70 70 70 70 70 70 67 40
and then own brand will start to grow much more quicker	79 79 43 79 79 79 79 76 76 49 79
for my own exams if you ' re watching this	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40
major production cities like los angeles	79 79 79 79 79 80
your own future income that way for	53 52 40 40 40 40 40
with like trying to be the best	49 50 50 50 49 76 76
mobility you know if you ' re in the honey	49 49 50 50 50 50 50 41 50 50
acting teacher can me and he is we he	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
are not going to be seen by anyone	79 79 76 76 49 49 49 50
older ones we also did change out the	79 79 79 52 52 43 70 71
if there ' s any questions specifically	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
80 % LTV or lower once you get to that	70 70 70 79 70 70 70 70 70 70
a payment just because you forgot to	49 49 79 79 79 79 71
learned how to make websites when I was	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a market in terms of just film and tv	50 51 50 50 50 80 80 53 50
reels start off	41 37 37
mastermind so with a hot seat style	49 79 79 79 79 79 79
story because there are union	49 49 49 49 49
is if the course is actually good	63 63 63 63 62 71 71
costs are just too high here and the	49 49 79 79 71 71 71 79
how it works is you can basically deduct	70 70 79 52 52 52 52 43
in 2008 famously there was a bit of a crash	61 61 67 40 31 31 31 31 40 49
I ' m so unproductive I ' m so unmotivated	53 53 53 26 44 80 80 80 80 80
city and see if there are opportunities	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
only thing that ' s good about these	79 79 79 79 79 70 71 70
not the only	71 68 67
your car now you have guaranteed that	70 68 49 49 71 71 41
relationship between new things and	0 0 0 0 0
and this happened to me before so nah i	68 41 49 49 49 49 49 40 40
because in the longterm house prices always go up	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
books if you ' re going to attend seminars	28 28 28 28 28 28 28 31 28
you can get a thousand people who like	40 41 50 50 19 19 19 49
series credits you actually write your	0 0 0 0 0 0
like your poor until you make	79 79 79 79 79 70
for it to count as a write - off you have	37 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
work with	53 53
you can afford based on your income	31 31 40 40 41 40 40
and professionals will have to say and	41 41 41 77 41 71 71
and do this for a very long period of time	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 60
This is not inflation - adjusted for any economists among us	40 79 79 79 79 79 40 40 49 49 49
certification exam sometimes multiple	77 77 80 80
different benefits of investing in a	1 31 31 31 31 31
planning help certainly but it does go	49 40 40 49 49 49 49
the end of the scene at your end mark	51 51 78 78 50 50 71 71 71
look like this	50 50 49
who substitutes for the principal actor	40 40 40 70 70 40
in the thumbnail i wrote that monologues	44 44 41 41 41 41 41
doesn ' t really apply here so you are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
even up to 100 homes before they get an	40 40 40 40 44 53 53 53 80
is that an environment that appeals to your aesthetics	41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
comfortable with it took the role I	30 30 30 30 30 29 29
know the bucking and fitness community	50 50 50 50 49 37
things and the last thing i want you to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when that movie comes out and i go watch	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that you ' ll be pretty good like not	52 52 52 52 50 49 49 49 76
sure i had already exists so that let us	71 68 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
or small investment property and then	40 40 41 40 40 40
i ' ll put a link to it in the description	26 26 26 26 22 22 67 70 70 71 70
i would be cut off from almost all the	49 49 49 49 49 49 79 71 71
they ' re probably only going to watch the	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
business and you have thirty thousand	59 40 40 13 40 58
like in all the different aspects of	70 43 52 52 43 43 70
paint over all that get rid of those	79 77 79 79 79 79 79 79
and perfect and seemed effortless it	41 41 49 49 49 49
that same $ 500 , 000 home you ' re putting	62 70 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
literally just happened to me you guys i	49 49 49 41 41 41 41 41
it ' s going to be life - changing for so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
i wasn ' t thinking clearly that night we	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
multi - unit property then yeah you can	32 32 32 40 40 41 44 40
mastermind that means that instead of	79 79 79 79 79 79
as long as we go first	49 49 49 49 49 79
Or recently I wouldn ' t stop playing on my Nintendo Switch	71 71 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 67
you would put the name of the show and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
get approved for that loan of course you	80 79 80 80 40 40 40 40
this sustainable for me is there are	32 41 41 32 41 41 41
w - 2 they still won ' t pay taxes or even	31 31 31 31 40 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
actually let me say that let me	41 50 50 41 41 50 50
You need to get a mortgage	50 50 51 51 50 80
they want to see a professional headshot	79 79 79 79 79 76 79
forces us to think about	67 46 73 46 46
through working with a scene partner and	40 40 67 67 67 40 67
for your auditions the more that you do	76 79 79 79 76 76 79 79
You ' re gonna think " Oh my God	79 79 79 79 49 49 49 41 41
students student filmmakers many	40 40 41 70
shot of tequila at the bar	76 79 79 49 79 79
interesting and you will be remembered	49 68 68 68 68 71
I don ' t have a high interest credit card debt	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
make sure to check out this video which	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
by the algorithm	67 67 67
I ' ve tried to actively think about more	55 55 55 58 58 61 61 55 55
I ' ve been following Gary Vaynerchuk for	79 79 79 79 79 79 46 49
just take action if you ' re young get	32 40 40 40 31 31 31 34 34
And you ' re not gonna see any returns for a very long time	67 67 67 67 67 70 67 64 64 67 67 67 70 70
investing by one single year is going to	40 40 40 40 71 70 70 70
and things are right now and would you	71 71 71 71 71 64 67 67
another easy ish one to learn is video	21 0 0 19 0 0 0 0
gym throughout my whole acting training	23 23 20 20 20 20
business that i do have a lot of people	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And that ' s been the final lesson that I learnt in 2019	64 64 64 64 67 67 70 49 37 46 46 46 71
YouTube tends to take a 45 % cut of CPMs	58 61 58 61 61 61 61 61 61 61
you increase your chances dramatically	64 64 64 64 67
marketing affiliate marketing is when	49 49 79 79 79
producers where the project is shooting	49 49 80 71 40 40

like show business right well there ' s a	79 79 79 79 79 68 68 68 71
the time	79 76
like really listening and being aware of	49 49 49 50 50 49 49
I should probably film a video	49 76 52 79 70 49
of the producers on the movie	67 67 67 76 76 73
it for 29	0 0 0
then have this supply and demand thing	64 64 64 64 64 64 67

training what else can you do	70 79 79 79 79 79
you understand what an actor ' s schedule	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
not try and create new things	70 49 49 40 49 79
getting pre - approved for a residential	31 40 40 40 40 40 41
markets like los angeles or new york if	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
I think I ' ve got a link in the description	49 40 40 40 40 49 40 49 49 49 49
don ' t care how big the movie was i don	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 49 49
as a business expense	79 79 76 76
underneath this we ' re going to do this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
of the concept and then lets you apply	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

that ' s okay you ' ve got the internet and	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 67 76 1
then if you go closer and closer to my	76 76 76 28 37 37 37 37 37
those of you that live overseas and got	68 68 68 72 71 71 71 71

really experienced mentor who can guide	79 79 79 79 79 79
miss is it ' s still really important to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
for taping your auditions at home i	71 71 71 71 71 68 71
Therefore we ' re technically not losing money over time	67 61 61 61 61 61 70 70 40 31

on the older generations as well	79 79 79 79 79 79
keep practicing keep learning and i hope	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
different ways to find auditions without	41 41 41 41 67 70
home so we ' re gonna use that as the	71 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 79
Basically what it means is that	49 49 52 43 49 80
it ' s like trying to get admission to	67 67 67 67 43 43 41 41 71
low budget indie films where the stakes	70 70 70 70 79 79 79

that is more modern that ' s more of the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
step number 12 is to be patient and	1 21 21 19 21 1 19 21
shaq ' s parts in a totally separate room	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 49

but in my second year of medical school	68 65 64 64 64 64 64 64

gonna make the most money for you based	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
type of information that you will get	70 70 70 67 67 67 71
for business purposes is actually gonna be tech	40 40 67 67 67 40 31 31
the acting career center here to help	71 71 71 71 71 71 68
are so yeah that kind of concludes this	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
so take that background work off your	49 50 43 41 49 49 49
two - way street	49 49 49 41
spending some time here with me today	71 71 71 71 71 71 70
But in this blog post he talks about this	70 67 70 70 70 70 70 49 49
if everybody ' s saying the same thing how	79 79 79 79 71 79 79 79 79
casting process so if we don ' t have	71 71 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
so here ' s how the audition process went	49 49 49 49 41 41 71 71 40
miss any payments or have anything go	40 40 40 41 41 31 31
They ' re not subscribed to my channel	67 67 67 67 31 31 58 67
would love to be a graphic designer	67 67 67 67 67 40 31
look comfortable natural and real on	79 79 79 79 79 79
agent well those people are getting way	52 79 79 67 67 67 67
or they ' ll be looking for a very	80 80 80 80 77 77 77 77 77
little girl the reason that I booked it	67 67 67 68 68 68 59 68
shooting on set so for instance if	79 80 80 80 71 70 52
snowball rolling	41 79
with your friends from school and all study together	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 77
If you ' re still here I apologize for being so ramble	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
yeah and I think one of the other things	5 49 49 49 50 40 40 40 40
the more money you save now	31 31 70 70 70 61
he does what he calls high leverage housekeeping	49 49 49 49 41 41 49 52
some training and then you will have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i find that they have accurate questions	40 49 49 49 49 19 0
are not going to be any more free acting	80 80 77 77 77 77 76 49 49
Like actually getting that first thousand subscribers	76 76 76 67 58 58 58
agents out there that you ' ve never heard	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
professionally so that ' s what you need	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
topic some casting directors say sure go	67 67 70 70 70 70 49
book over 50 movies and television shows	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
also don ' t forget to smile if your story	71 49 49 49 80 71 71 71 49 49
and it might be a little controversial	71 71 71 71 71 0 0
really just comes down to your goals so	46 46 46 46 49 49 49 50
to do it but	80 80 53 50
student films are exactly what they	41 41 49 49 49 49
your bedroom and you ' re showing that	46 40 41 28 28 28 31 37
the things that we ' ve learned	43 79 52 79 79 79 79
film and television actors union is sag	71 71 67 67 67 67 67
video because that would make this video	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and making friends in the unlikeliest of circumstances	79 79 79 79 11 20 21 21
magic number and it ' s a win for the	70 70 70 70 70 70 61 61 70 70
But these days they make roundabout 60	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
But let ' s say I wanted to buy something	61 31 31 31 40 81 80 70 67 61
I now appreciate why some people say that running is fun	77 77 76 76 76 76 76 73 73 76 76
avoidable by	70 79

before in a previous video where we	41 41 41 68 68 41 41
background work on your acting resume it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0

those things for quite a while and you	80 79 76 76 79 79 79 79

stay safe they high decay we will	41 41 11 11 11 11 11
and then the results will be all the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hands - on you can get i know a lot of	40 40 40 31 31 31 40 40 49 79 49
why I recommend for most people with a	71 79 79 71 71 71 61 58
what i would say is if you are in this	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
Point number seven is I discovered	49 49 49 41 49 49
visually going to be a happening and	33 33 33 33 33 33 33
that bus joint has been incredible as	79 79 80 79 79 79 79
the audition	71 71
can contact them	71 77 77
then you can sign up for an imdb pro	70 70 70 70 70 70 80 77 79
doctors so by the same token agents sign	49 79 76 77 71 67 76 79
you ' re supposed to do	50 50 50 50 50 50
series of online courses aimed at	76 76 76 73 73 76
as a whole of the S & amp ; P 500 you get a general idea	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
services and in fact you can even sell	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
house is probably going to be the	13 13 40 25 25 25 52
every audition is a win because of and	76 79 76 79 79 79 79 76
i couldn ' t make the second audition they	79 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 40
regular people because that ' s who the general public will identify with	40 40 41 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 41
well those training videos hire actors	61 61 58 7 61 31
if they interviewed a basketball player	80 71 71 71 71 71
they make their final decision they cast	77 68 68 71 68 65 68
typically used in the commercial world	79 79 79 80 80 71
now if i lived in california or new york	43 43 52 80 80 67 67 67 67
major leak in the house that ' s why a	49 49 49 49 49 31 31 31 40 49
actual words that are written and just	71 40 40 40 40 40 41
from and into because if we ' re not	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
time in your business set or it just	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
per business mile driven so let ' s say in	40 31 67 31 31 40 40 40 49 49
typically a casting director will reach	49 49 41 41 49 49
is to start a YouTube channel	62 62 62 58 58 58
if you don ' t know what a stand - in is	79 79 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 40
because the job is ultimately meaningless	71 71 71 71 71 71
meeting new people and needing to break the ice	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
those are all extra expenses for the	49 50 50 80 80 80 80
so if you hear about a role that you	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 76 76
because normally for investment	31 40 40 31
this we are almost always doing	49 41 44 53 49 53
you can also put on if you ' ve done any	49 49 49 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 79
retailers that	61 61
right you want to have a	79 76 73 73 76 79
they ' re going to say well show me some	68 68 68 68 41 40 40 41 41 41
families by just doing commercials	79 49 41 41 41
you ' re gonna get the best rate possible	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
channel because	71 71
loan costs and that ' s gonna add up to no	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your profiles on these websites are	43 43 43 43 40 49
are on the right track if you want to	67 67 67 67 40 49 40 40 40
I ' m gonna give $ 100 a month difficulty a four - star rating	79 79 79 50 19 19 19 19 19 46 46 46 46 46 49
going to be on tv	79 79 79 79 79
and now he ' s selling it for lots of money	25 25 25 25 25 25 25 52 52 25 25
to save you a lot of money it ' s going to	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71 71 71 71
i went full time	79 79 79 79
yeah I ' ve gotten this personal results	50 22 22 22 49 49 49 49
this is basically everything that i	50 50 50 52 49 49
off - book they ' re asking you do you have	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
And when you get to actually being a doctor and	76 80 80 71 71 76 76 76 76 76
printer if you do check to see if it can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you can still use this	49 50 49 49 49
skill to have	80 80 71
W I L you period	0 0 0 0 0
anymore so that is the biggest	53 50 40 43 71 71
whenever you go into an audition by the	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 73
footage that we can use for ourselves	52 52 79 79 79 79 49
most money actually join a brokerage and	67 70 67 40 70 70 67
things the	1 1
doing well and is on track to becoming a	67 40 40 40 68 70 67 67 40
excited to be talking about something I	71 71 71 62 62 62 68
That ' s got less of an obvious benefit	52 52 52 70 52 52 79 79 79
there for your clients you won ' t have as	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
account and then you can put your	79 80 80 80 80 71 71
down in the description below step	50 68 71 71 71 76
just think to yourself " This is going to be fast	67 67 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 52
probably wasn ' t quite that bad but it	41 49 49 49 40 41 41 41 49
male or female so that ' s the character	40 40 40 40 31 31 31 31 31
is that	79 79
and this has a lot to do with	79 79 79 79 76 79 79 79
in this video	80 0 0
this is a follow - up video to a video i	77 68 68 67 67 67 70 70 77 77 71
And should spare that $ 10 a month	1 1 0 0 0 0 11 1
and you ' ve been able to apply your	51 50 50 50 47 41 41 41 50
crank through it it ' s probably not gonna	42 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50
about this	44 40
audition sides we have the role that we	71 40 70 70 70 70 70 70
character or should you just dress as	71 71 79 49 49 49 49
because it ' s a good	80 80 80 80 70 70

And the way that I ' ve applied this flywheel concept	64 64 67 67 67 67 67 67 64 37 37
that i have made the third investment	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in the united states movies and tv shows	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
this is all your monthly payments	40 40 40 41 41 31
For me I kinda struggle with	49 52 26 26 50 79
soft white light it wasn ' t too yellow	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
need it what ' s the harm and bringing it	40 40 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41
example let ' s say there ' s a new movie	71 71 71 71 70 49 49 49 49 70 70
very common and this happened to me many	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
Like when I get home from work let ' s say it ' s 9PM	50 53 23 26 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 53
and you then gain the opportunity for serendipity	49 50 49 52 52 49 49 76

most common terms that you will hear at	70 70 70 70 67 67 71 67

you ' re having a headache or whatever	49 49 49 49 41 44 68 71

personal finance entrepreneurship and	50 50 50 50
in this video we are exploring some real	79 79 79 79 76 79 79 79

review these questions and you need to	37 41 41 40 10 10 37
something very similar made by Canon or	79 79 79 79 79 49 79
too big of a hassle but honestly you	79 79 79 79 40 49 49 49
that ' s why it ' s so exciting and it ' s a	31 31 31 10 10 10 10 41 32 32 40 40 40 40

what projects i ' m working on so i ' ve had	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
down in the description of this video	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
for you feel free to let it go and try	46 49 40 37 37 49 49 46 37 40
because no one can time the market	70 70 70 70 70 70 61
And that just felt like it kind of felt like cheating	33 33 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 33
know this but	10 10 31
expensive le at least a million or two	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And that ' s not even in the video front	81 80 80 80 80 80 80 81 81 80
And then they give you the solution and kind of explain it	79 79 76 73 73 76 76 76 76 76 76 73
control over as the actors so that ' s why	0 0 41 41 71 68 67 67 67 67
working on your craft and becoming the	77 77 77 77 77 77 77
that goes into an audition with an 8 and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

this works mostly at places like	70 79 79 79 70 71
So the point that Derek Sivers makes in his blog post	70 67 76 79 49 79 70 70 70 70 70
reel to get work and how do i create a	40 31 31 67 40 40 40 40 40 40

right there okay that ' s it for this	49 49 49 52 52 52 77 77 50
there you can say ah do it for a fiver	77 77 77 76 76 76 73 73 76 76
having a yard is incredibly hard and	40 40 70 70 43 79 70
so if you have had a totally different	40 40 40 40 40 43 43 43
things so automated and you ' re working	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
different way to ask and when you do	40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49

we ' re going to talk about three headshot	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77
saying the other lines of the other	76 76 76 76 76 76 49

could in your business	79 79 79 79
filmmakers in your area once you join	71 68 71 71 71 67 70
that i ' ve been in for about six months	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
acting or theater and this kind of goes	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

that were not written	76 76 76 43

So if you ' ve got a business	40 49 70 70 70 70 40 43
union member you can only work on union	67 67 40 40 40 40 70 70
word keeping all capitalization and	40 70 70 40 41
right now almost everybody has a phone	67 67 41 41 50 77 77
yeah he ' s going and then going through	49 40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49
requires lots of upfront effort in terms	49 49 49 49 76 58 58
marketing um there ' s this general rule	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you did it in a local theater you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
know how to gain experience but	49 49 49 49 40 50
guarantee that you will book the role in	79 79 71 71 71 71 71 71
the walking dead for instance	0 0 0 0 0
you and come back in a frame this way so	76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
which is one of the most important books	76 76 76 76 49 49 76 76
if this is your first time here make	67 67 68 68 68 68 68 65
express so i went ahead and just took my	53 53 53 53 53 53 53 52 52
even indirectly then these types of	79 49 49 49 79 79
around about $ 12 , 000 invested in the S & amp ; P 500	64 76 79 79 79 79 49 49 79 73 73 73 73 73 73
sometimes two three four five hundred	77 76 76 80 80 80
it ' s not gonna be comfortable you	71 71 71 79 79 79 79 79
certainly is not required	76 79 79 76
example for um you know what i ' m doing	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that you take	41 41 41
you will hear	67 67 71
now i think everyone would agree that	71 79 79 71 71 71 71
that there are actors that move to the	49 77 72 80 77 77 77 77

from the book that really resonated with	40 43 43 43 43 43 40

Let ' s have a look at some of my more popular videos	67 67 67 67 71 71 49 49 49 79 79 79 79
so i ' ve been a working actor for almost	41 41 41 41 41 49 49 52 52 49
and it ' s just so much harder to to learn	40 49 49 49 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
able to share more	49 49 49 41
one of the most common questions I get	43 43 43 43 43 70 70 67
and if you have any questions remember	76 76 76 76 76 49 41
joining the sag	73 73 73

when you ' re watching the show I	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 73

meaning people will buy um about three	49 50 41 41 49 49 49
experience we all start	49 49 50 49
your acting career	40 40 40
So yeah I really began to appreciate	49 49 49 52 79 71 71
always come back to thinking about how	79 79 79 79 80 79 79
actors access and casting networks	70 67 70 71 71
And so the conundrum that we ' re dealing with	58 70 70 67 58 55 55 55 58 40
to sit down and learn to code	76 76 76 76 76 76 76
Don ' t worry about working	49 49 49 49 49 49
all right i don ' t want to do this and	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40 40
to discuss today about how	70 70 67 67 67
psychologically am I am I just in a	51 51 51 51 42 42 42 42
realized this when i was just getting	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
they ' ll be working with	68 68 68 71 71 71
compare that to a normal brokerage	31 28 1 31 31 31
lesson that i learned	41 41 41 41
it ' s usually the producers and the	52 52 52 70 71 79 67 70
that while i might not be able to	16 16 52 52 79 79 79 79
And just that kind of color coding	1 0 0 0 0 55 59
and say that there are many	41 41 41 41 41 41
shooting with other photographers	71 79 79 79
booked my role	44 44 44
but what I ' ve realized over the last few months	46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 37 37 37
that takes a lot of effort to get going	67 67 67 67 70 70 67 67 67
exercising for it to even be effective	79 49 49 49 49 49 49
the casting director is looking at a sea	49 41 50 49 49 49 49 49
can really get a great workout and	50 49 49 49 49 49 49
and finding a ton of free resources	80 49 49 49 49 49 49
isn ' t laugh - out - loud funny or super	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
because i am working so much in film and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the exact right dimensions every single	79 79 79 79 79 79
and exactly what value you ' re providing	49 49 49 49 41 41 41 49
acting teachers that charge	80 71 79 79
there is still a high chance	63 63 63 63 63 63
essentially sharing that credit card	40 32 32 32 31
people understand that there	0 0 0 0
it ends up costing my business 40	31 70 43 61 58 58 61
differences are between being non	67 49 49 76 76
important to talk to a lender they	31 32 32 32 31 31 31
wanted to be super cool and therefore	1 1 0 1 0 0 0
consistently do about a couple hours per	32 40 40 40 40 40 40
but it ' s very hard to become a good one	79 76 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 70 70
see you guys in the next video	44 44 41 41 14 17 0
download my 10 - step audition preparation	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
they actually invested but with all this	71 71 40 40 40 40 40
into your actual house - hunting because	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of neighborhoods are going to do well	40 40 40 40 44 43 34
say fifty dollars to two hundred dollars	80 80 79 70 70 79 79
one day	0 0
standing up for an audition they make no	40 40 40 40 49 40 76 49
every person that ends up taking this	40 40 40 31 31 40 40
and all that kind of crap is that it doesn ' t recognize	79 71 67 67 67 67 76 76 76 67 67 67 41
for a brief moment let me give you an example let ' s say the scene that you	71 71 71 71 68 41 41 71 71 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49
all of that work is the 90 this is the	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 74 77
for the next year	32 32 32 32
it so that ' s why i recommend a scene	71 70 40 40 40 40 40 67 67 40
if you guys are donating it make sure to	68 41 40 49 49 40 40 40 40
anymore like are those like sentence	79 79 79 79 79 79
like three times and then here we would	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is really going to add up just note that	80 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
into the templates so there was a lot of	71 71 71 71 79 79 79 79 79
two on my list is	25 44 70 70 40
are people who don ' t know who I am	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
But that meant that all of the coding	50 50 49 49 49 49 49 79
come to me with injuries and in fact I	41 41 41 41 41 40 40 40 41
up to a whopping	40 40 31 61
And I ' ve started actively tracking this	49 79 79 79 49 49 79 79
because this is show business	80 79 79 79 79
you ' ll have an audience and you ' ll be able to make	49 49 49 49 49 49 52 52 52 52 53 53 44 71
congratulations you guys watch this	19 31 31 31 31
or to invest in the self - taping setup at	49 49 49 70 70 70 70 70 71 71
so i hope all that makes sense in terms	50 50 41 41 41 41 41 50 50
once you have a couple	64 64 67 67 67
you take something like an	79 79 79 79 40
more turnkey but there are some things	61 61 61 71 70 79 79
for and i don ' t think that ' s a great	79 79 79 80 80 80 79 79 79 79 79 79
just buy a condo or a single family	40 40 32 31 41 31 31 31
have a particularly profitable year	0 0 0 0 40
And there ' s a really long one about	10 10 10 10 10 10 1 1 10
forcing people to join	71 71 50 49
or a star wars movie	79 79 79 79 80
you know if you ' re spending more money	70 70 40 40 40 40 31 34 61
Because again you have to be able to provide value	26 53 44 71 71 71 62 62 61 53
and I always kinda thought that	67 67 40 67 67 31
to pay 24 grand for a brand new Tesla Model 3	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 76 73 77 77
other things one of the most important	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
point you are supercharging your	22 22 22 0 0
bachelor ' s and a master ' s degree	70 70 70 71 71 71 71 71 71
character is totally different than who	79 79 79 79 79 79
as a way of acting they only think about	71 49 52 52 52 40 40 67 67
Firstly don ' t worry	79 79 79 79 79
question you want to know what you	71 71 71 79 79 49 49
phones or cameras that can shoot 4k	52 79 52 52 52 52 52
say stick with something safer so yeah	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
which leaves me with 27 , 337 pounds and 50p	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 81 79
that they will be shooting on set that	67 64 64 67 67 67 67 70

to know what sort of things I was looking for	67 80 80 80 77 68 70 67 64 64
is corporate industrial videos or	50 49 49 40 50
can create your own footage	41 41 41 41 41
definitely go for it but there are	49 70 49 49 49 49 49
footage meaning a demo reel to show us	40 40 67 67 40 41 41 41
not to get an agent the first step is	71 53 26 26 53 80 80 71 67
your body	49 49

a lot saved up now what I like to tell	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70 79
everything onto one page of a resume it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall	67 67 67 59 68 67 67 77 76
part of an audition is what ' s going on	73 74 74 77 77 77 77 77 77 77
is to use a little bit of math and crop	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
or time on your self education now i	79 49 52 79 79 79 80 80
actually just hire your kids this is a	37 37 31 40 40 40 40 40
go through you ' ll get scheduled a date	79 79 62 62 62 62 79 70 70
I need to be motivated to watch this next episode	44 53 53 53 53 53 43 79 80 80
clearer picture of what you need to do	40 40 67 40 40 67 67 67
and and it ' s a fair question that a lot	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
credit score so let ' s say that you have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
show agents that you are serious about	71 77 80 71 71 71 53
that could throw them off right then and	80 80 79 79 79 79 79 79
into making these like websites and these projects	79 79 49 79 79 71 71 67
on zoom unfortunately i was not	41 41 41 41 41 41
it could be chest up it could be waist	23 23 23 23 26 26 26 26 49
them out in any way you can as well	73 76 68 68 71 71 71 71 71
So this varies massively but let ' s say on average	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41
cars at all times you never know when	50 50 76 79 52 52 53 52
or whatever to make $ 100 a month	49 49 41 49 41 41 41 41
see you guys in the next video	41 41 41 41 41 41 0
and they might wanna do it	40 40 41 41 49 49
okay next is just having too many	49 49 49 49 49 41 68
know if your goal is to run five miles	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
And it piles absolutely everything that I now know	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
house people loved this kitchen because	20 0 0 0 0 12
She had zero audiences at the time	76 79 79 41 41 41 41
And the reason for that is because it ' s boring	68 68 70 70 43 43 43 43 43 43 43
in life in general	49 49 50 50
have a photo printer but never even knew	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
my take on props and auditions agree	80 80 80 80 80 80 79
I ' d recommend starting with the basics	26 26 26 26 53 53 26 53
actually drags me up the mountain just	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if someone didn ' t do that in real life for an extended period of time	49 49 49 49 49 49 40 71 71 71 49 79 79 79 79 49
the box is there an opportunity	80 79 79 80 79 79
that nobody else has and the way that i	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you put in there you can look at past	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
or like ISAs or LISAs in the UK	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
cannot audition for a commercial for	53 50 80 80 80 80
now your chances are a lot slimmer also	76 76 49 40 70 70 70 70
dozens of movies and television shows so	41 71 68 41 41 41 41
you know looked at scale on a daily	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
channel making content about their local	79 70 79 79 61 79
you would need 15 people every month to sign up	49 49 49 40 41 40 40 50 50 50
so what can you do to increase your	49 41 41 41 41 41 71 71
a reason why you should a couple of	79 80 70 71 52 71 71 52
for future projects future roles	40 40 40 40 49
they just sit on the market for a long	43 79 79 79 79 52 79 79 79
and what we morally believe and thirdly	40 43 79 70 10 10 10
you solve that problem and then you charge money for it	58 58 58 58 70 79 79 79 79 79 49
over a hundred weddings in the past five	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
basically go on Hargreaves Lansdown	79 79 79 79 79
friends have told me that they ' ve seen	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
is you want to be able to invest in index funds	64 67 67 67 40 40 41 51 51 50 50
auditioning and career advice every	71 71 71 71 71
is because when you have a brand that is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
cpa or tax strategist about this	61 43 79 79 70 43
yeah they are quite confident that you	0 40 40 40 40 40 40
if you ' re doing an online course for	40 40 40 40 49 49 49 41 41
the fact is that there are roles out there for absolutely	41 49 49 41 41 41 41 49 49 49 41
stapling it or taping it on the back	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and i ' m able to open up one of these	52 52 52 52 70 70 43 52 79 79 79
from the crowd	67 67 68
the rest of the cast remember that they	68 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
offering some kind of service and you	49 49 49 49 40 40 49
questions that you eventually see on the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
for example when i rented out the other	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
nope that is definitely not the case you	40 40 40 40 70 70 70 43
headshots these days so it ' s important	70 44 71 68 76 76 76 76
I was so focused on trying to climb that you know	79 79 79 70 70 79 79 70 70 70 79
and you ' re gonna think people are looking at you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70 79 70
share with a friend and also hit that	41 40 41 41 41 41 41 40
knowledge pretty well you ' ve actively	70 70 70 70 70 70 79
to get started now that being said let	71 71 41 41 41 41 40 40
buying products like clothes food	19 79 79 71 71
all six of them cool but make sure	50 50 50 50 49 49 49 49
wash with the day of	71 71 67 67 67
federal income tax as well as state	4 31 31 28 28 1 31
when you combine those you get an index fund	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
your property	79 71
sample deal which	71 79 79
for many other things	49 49 41 41
control doesn ' t mean we should just	67 67 67 67 49 49 49 76
the night you pack your lunch for	50 50 50 50 50 50 50
no matter where you live and besides	79 79 79 79 71 79 40
people will ask well why do i have to	71 71 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
thumbs up and if you haven ' t already	71 70 70 67 67 68 68 68 68
pain free performance specialist and we	40 40 40 40 41 50
thumbs up	79 79
auditions i didn ' t end up booking them	76 76 79 79 79 79 79 70 76
to get a role that is a small supporting	50 68 71 71 50 50 50 68 80
in cleveland ohio	44 71 49
won ' t appreciate at the time because you ' ll think	44 44 44 1 1 1 1 1 19 19 19 19
And that ' s like $ 60 , 000 a month in passive income	25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 52 79 79 70
don ' t really exist because it ' s just way too high	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76
per month in rental income and if you	19 19 20 20 11 11 11 11
like that speaking of websites i do want	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
and about how you want to house hack and	79 52 79 79 79 80 79 79 79
this is probably the most competitive	76 76 79 79 79 79
reading what I found and I don ' t know	52 52 49 49 40 40 68 68 68 70
are not going to pay you any money	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50
character was in their 20s or 30s as	52 52 79 52 79 79 79 79
bring up the energy okay before we end	49 71 71 71 79 71 71 71
term is a breakdown now a breakdown can	79 79 70 70 70 79 79 70
owner you are entitled to	31 31 31 31 31
i thought that type of thing only	79 79 40 43 68 44 71
How amazing humanity is how friendly people are	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
talk and you also get to listen so when	37 37 37 40 40 40 40 40 40
productions are not going to pay	71 53 50 50 49 76
more often than on a movie or a	80 50 50 80 80 70 71 71
the next section is training	0 0 0 0 0
those producers to do everything the	67 67 67 67 67 67
this particular youtube channel is	49 40 70 70 70
and you ' re just your business is growing	79 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79
- As in like more than $	50 40 49 49 49 49 49
is just the short description of each	80 50 50 50 80 76 79
three hours of your week there ' s a	46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 50
Even if I ' m really not feeling up to it	40 67 67 67 67 67 67 40 40 40 70
you ' re paying taxes upfront and with the	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 28
normal computer paper either the next	49 49 49 49 70 71
But when it comes to assessing how hard is this to do	70 70 70 67 68 59 58 58 58 58 58 58
only 18 years old because i started my	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
loan is reserved for veterans and	79 79 70 71 70 70
is budgetary reasons you got to	70 70 70 80 80 80
don ' t go in with a certain meat in mind	70 70 70 70 40 40 37 40 40 40 40
Riverside makes it very easy	79 58 58 58 58
side someone on your team	79 70 70 70 70
as a teenager or as like a 12 year old	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And when you invest let ' s say $ 1 , 000 in the S & amp ; P 500	52 49 49 49 41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
actor the penultimate item on my list	49 49 71 71 71 71 65
we probably wouldn ' t consider that fun	71 49 49 49 49 49 79 67
auditioning for a project	41 41 41 41
get your license in about three months	34 58 31 40 40 40 40
project so let ' s say a project shoots	40 67 67 67 67 67 67 79 79
But if you ' re new to the game	49 49 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to increase stability in my body I want	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and pass that state exam in california	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
ties right back to your when I ' m talking	23 50 49 49 22 22 23 23 23 22
inch lights look better on your ceiling	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

that is and how that ' s helping people	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50 50
demo reel	80 41
license I got mine in two months so all	76 79 49 79 79 79 79 79 79
see first because if you bought a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and sometimes actors would just say well	79 79 79 52 52 52 52
to see you on set one day	71 71 71 0 0 0 0
five dollars per transaction and	62 71 71 70 70
at what doesn ' t isn ' t necessary and then	28 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
getting a great workout I feel it in	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
in my opinion when you perform a scene	41 40 41 41 41 41 41 41
And that brings us on to investing in shares	70 37 31 67 70 70 58 31 31
that i found most useful when preparing	40 49 40 40 41 41 23
they have an audition	71 71 71 71

agent to help me get those credits	49 76 76 76 76 76 76
for epson they were shooting	71 71 41 49 40

steal it one day and just nice and read	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 46
of those and added better projects that	50 20 51 51 50 51 51
And you don ' t even remember like	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to a new york or an la	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
seems very unlikely right and in many	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
sometimes we forget so how can we	71 71 71 71 67 67 76
tell me about yourself question and an	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
check those out and without any further	41 41 71 71 71 71 49

easiest way of getting people to know	50 53 53 53 44 71 71
these are the things that i did a ton of	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50
things my current demo reel is a	50 50 50 50 50 50 50

smaller scenes that just move the story	40 40 40 40 31 31 31
I don ' t think that works for most people	49 49 49 49 49 40 40 40 67 67
thing i do want to point out is i would	68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 71 71
trade more than 80 thousand hours of our	-29 0 -29 -29 -29 0 0 0

in working with an agent that doesn ' t go	40 50 50 50 77 41 41 41 41 41

finally avoid babbling keep it short and	71 50 71 68 71 68 71

all those things let ' s say you ' re even	70 71 71 70 70 70 67 76 76 76 76
a competitive market you ' ll want to save	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
together for so long and I do feel like	49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41
and there are a lot of calculators out	49 49 49 49 49 76 49 52
Like I literally do nothing for my Skillshare classes	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
trying to become a real estate agent I	76 79 67 70 70 70 70 70

gain acting experience you can actually	71 71 71 71 71 71
we ' re doing the things that we ' re doing	80 80 80 80 41 49 79 79 79 79 71
audition right there on the spot that	67 67 67 67 67 67 70
college nearby that has a filmmaking	70 70 53 50 80 80
information in that course was really	0 0 0 0 0 0
I actually don ' t give a toss	67 67 67 67 67 67 70 49
callback then i got put on first refusal	43 67 64 64 67 67 40 40
new york	67 70
more videos on acting	71 71 71 71
many years ago when I was still	71 49 49 41 41 41 41
And this sorta goes back to this idea of a flywheel	43 40 40 41 77 68 71 71 79 49 49
base pay for a sag after a full budget	50 50 43 40 40 67 40 79 79
i found out that i got another audition	44 44 44 44 44 44 44 71
overdo your makeup and when your	52 79 79 67 67 67
Over time we can see it doesn ' t really change much	32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
remember that every single dime that you	67 71 68 41 41 41 68
and everyone ' s really friendly	50 49 49 49 49 49
foremost to see for a good fit you know	50 50 49 50 50 50 50 50 50
estate transaction i can almost	79 79 79 79 79
is that first you have to gain	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
it makes us feel like amateurs that	43 49 49 79 70 70 49
everything and ultimately it does make	79 79 79 79 80 80
want to dip into that emergency fund	70 70 70 67 79 70 79
write shoot edit and basically complete	50 50 50 50 50 50
gonna remember those like extra few bits	76 76 76 76 76 76 76
it shouldn ' t be too hard	58 58 58 58 58 58 58
the second i think about is do you have	79 79 79 79 79 76 76 76 79
today i ' m going to be sharing a story of	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
and then your investment plummeted by 50	79 79 79 79 79 76 79
spend money on the right things	79 79 79 79 79 79
the gospel movie goes away This is at worst	71 71 41 41 71 71 71 71 71
foundation of acting	50 49 49
and i almost quit college and did it but	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actor but i can tell you	80 80 80 80 80 80
so every expense that we have everything	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Again link to all of these in my email newsletter	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
and that ' s where my foundation is that	70 52 52 52 52 79 79 70 79
what you ' ve done but when you go to an	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
And then we ' ve got a 97 88 95 100 100	70 67 70 70 70 70 70 76 76 76 67 79
so you better be prepared all the time	71 71 71 71 50 52 52 52
if you drive a lot of miles but you have	40 40 40 37 31 28 31 31 40 49
estate license if you have any questions	70 70 71 79 49 79 79
back to the casting director for a	40 40 40 40 40 71 71
and then I ' d be looking forward	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the main thing that i would	79 79 79 79 79 79
and you feel like you just can ' t keep up	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
have helping you mentoring you and these	79 79 70 79 79 79 79
You have to knock on the door and see	67 67 76 49 49 49 49 49 49
is in a way giving a form of value	68 77 77 77 77 67 58 58 58
Now essentially if a video is sponsored	68 68 68 67 67 67 67
my senior year of high school	79 79 79 79 79 79
have a little bit more confidence in	41 50 50 71 80 80 80
have so many	76 76 76
do we bound through the door refreshed	80 80 81 81 81 81 81
and friday so be sure to stay tuned for	61 70 79 79 79 71 80 79 79
my website you ' ll find that list down in	64 67 67 67 67 71 71 71 71 71
audition number 1000 is gonna be it	79 79 71 71 71 71 71
that i would	79 79 79
november 6	49 49
to best use their time to get a workout	50 50 46 46 46 49 49 49 49
that we ' re only talking about sag after	52 49 49 49 49 49 79 79 52
rerun on the network	71 71 71 71
helps you understand that there are many	67 76 79 77 50 49 0
actors have demo reels and half don	80 80 40 40 40 40 40
costume for a specific character you	0 0 0 0 0 0
i guarantee you you ' re going to save	79 70 67 70 70 70 70 70 71
look that lots of people are going to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
i don ' t want to waste my time if i have	71 50 50 50 50 50 50 51 50 52 52 80
you can see just how amazing this	20 20 19 19 20 20 20
we ' re talking for most people you can	70 70 70 70 40 70 70 58 31
because the value of the house itself	79 79 49 41 70 70 67
i ' m just super interested in different	31 31 31 40 40 40 31 31
significantly lower and in the long term	31 41 40 40 40 40 41
commission off of all union jobs sag	71 71 80 80 53 53 53
And then you ' re gonna start falling behind	81 72 81 81 81 72 81 72 81
they tell you you need to be off	76 76 70 70 70 70 70 70
United States so now I ' m gonna overview	70 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
most production	80 49
keep learning keep practicing and i hope	68 71 71 71 71 71 71
about audition terminology specifically	52 41 41 68
into the film and television industry	71 41 71 70 70 70
to make that 10 % $ 1 , 200 a year which is $ 100 a month	76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
important we mentioned earlier that only	80 76 49 77 80 80
to join in	68 67 70
but i truly i think it is i think you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
personally have dealt with that without	49 49 49 49 49 49
that can definitely be a write - off there	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 43
if this is your first time here make	53 53 53 44 44 44 53 26
I ' m now making sort of between five and 15 pounds a day	33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
who takes family portraits at Sears but	80 80 80 71 71 71 70
because people already know like and trust you hopefully	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 61 58
with saving	76 76
it looks looks like a nice dream and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
a producer or a director or writer or	70 70 67 40 67 67 49 49
in the home this is basically just like	79 79 79 79 70 70 40 40
simply because you feel like you don	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you have any follow - up questions feel	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 67 68
or not you want to pay the fee every	71 71 71 44 71 71 71 79 52
that would be 50 , 000 pounds	79 79 79 52 52 52 49
because I ' m earning 1 % or 2 % off of this a 100 million	79 40 40 40 49 70 70 70 70 70 40 67 70 50 50 51
in the comments of my other videos that	64 67 67 68 68 68 68 71
starting an acting career	71 68 50 77
if you have a weekly podcast	76 76 76 76 67 64
reason that they signed me	41 41 41 41 41
for free	79 79
but nothing was scripted	41 49 49 49
make money when you make money meaning	71 67 71 71 71 79 79
is an exchange of our life energy but as	79 70 70 70 70 70 49 46 49
other character so when Jordan Brown	73 79 49 41 41 41
well the answer is that casting	71 71 80 80 79 79
the greasy pole of achievement	79 79 79 76 70
that so with me for example I ' ve got a	76 76 76 76 76 50 49 49 49 76 76
And the answer here is again quite easy	67 67 71 71 76 76 70 70
if you can simply do those things and couple that with and knock out	71 71 41 71 41 41 71 71 71 79 80 40 40 71
paper which is eight - and - a - half by 11	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
seasons where we feel like we are not	79 79 80 79 79 79 79 79
says in the commercial the next term is	77 80 80 80 41 79 52 43
like i said i ' ve worked on some great	70 67 67 67 67 67 67 70 67 67
and the wisdom to know the difference	41 80 80 80 79 79 79
keep that item because they assign a 100	28 31 31 31 31 41 41 31
training now a quick google search for	41 71 71 49 49 76 76
that I would give to my 18 year old self	58 71 44 61 61 61 70 61 70 52
Everyone knows that	64 67 67
ever handling the watch at all now I	49 41 41 41 41 41 41 70
Well overall since 2014 that ' s pretty cool	52 52 52 79 52 52 52 52 52
so let ' s set the scene here in a typical audition where there ' s a conversation	71 71 71 71 41 41 71 71 71 79 71 71 71 40 40 40 41 40
lenders so that leaves this insurance up	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
booked it and the day that we shot on	43 52 52 49 49 49 49 49 49
so you could write something like that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you ' re being paid fairly if you	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
would be a good idea to wear like an	49 76 52 52 52 52 52 68 68
pursuing a different career	76 73 76 76
helping you find auditions	50 80 41 71
come to find out that it was because	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
over the social stuff because it ' s only for eight weeks	76 76 77 76 76 76 76 76 77 77 77 76
switch enough because they think it	70 70 71 43 43 70
Brandon anywhere where do where do you	0 61 0 0 0 79 79
actually doesn ' t charge you	65 68 68 68 68 68
like you have to be genuinely really good	0 0 0 0 0 37 37 37
undercut you won ' t get taken advantage	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
it is a very hands	40 40 40 31 40
faster paced than others and I ' m not	49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 76
one huge lesson about auditioning that	71 71 71 71 71 71
And then what ' s really cool about this graph	33 33 32 32 32 32 33 33 33 33
small - market actor calm in this video	71 71 71 71 71 71 50 49
gonna talk about that in this video and	41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
something that i ' m really going to be	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 67 70
might make $ 0 some months you might make	40 67 67 67 40 67 67 40 40
commercial or in a project or someone	52 79 79 79 76 67 67
dab dab dab dab dab dab like 25 times	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 49
I ' ve been actively writing down FBR on top of the page	70 70 70 67 40 40 49 50 50 14 14 50 50
reason behind this is that if you go to	79 79 79 77 77 77 80 80 80
this now you may be wondering why I use	67 67 67 67 40 40 40 67 67
and " Pirates of the Caribbean " and the " Marvel " stuff	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
So how hard is it to get one person a month	53 44 53 53 53 53 53 50 49 49 49

certain health risks dependent upon that	41 41 41 41 41 41
do brush my teeth get changed in	50 23 50 53 26 80 53
the analysis and one direction classes is	64 67 71 71 71 71 71
( guitar music )	49 49 49 49
really get into this mindset before you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
from actingcareercenter	79 79
A Lifetime ISA is a very good deal	70 70 79 52 52 52 52 79
you can check out other resources that	40 40 43 70 70 67 70
immediately after watching this video	55 58 58 58 40
got started and i started at the age of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And if you can do those three things then it ' s you know	41 49 49 40 41 50 50 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
syndicate to all of the real estate	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
means the more money you can invest and	43 43 52 79 79 79 79 79
the LTV the more risky that loan is	61 70 70 79 70 70 70 70
think too many people they live	40 61 62 62 61 43
something to put on your resume it	41 71 71 71 71 71 71
purchase a house or sell their existing	40 40 67 40 40 40 67

Brandon anywhere where do you think he	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
their own looking online for houses that	52 52 79 79 79 79 79
those deals and like i mentioned earlier	79 79 79 52 79 79 79
when it when in reality	79 79 79 79 79
that ' s really cool because i actually	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 40
there are three bedrooms including one	79 79 79 79 79 79
description below this video step number	71 71 71 71 70 71
start out as an actor you don ' t have a	70 70 70 70 71 70 80 80 80 80 80
character of george who happens to	79 79 79 49 79 79
understand that these cities have really	79 52 49 41 41 41
making your monthly payment	40 40 40 40
my free	26 53
lean on well we can ' t unring this bell	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
streaming services they are way better	70 52 79 79 79 70
seriously just finish the course sort of	40 13 40 40 40 40 40
that i ' ve invested in the things that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
maintain our standard of living	50 19 49 49 49
in a community lower budget you	41 41 41 40 50 49
in this sort of field	49 49 49 49 49
easier and if you guys are really	31 32 31 31 31 31 40
I ' m sure many of you watching this video	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 41
have always been	67 67 73
set i made a little over a thousand	53 53 50 50 50 71 71 71
about how much nicer it ' d be for you to	41 40 49 49 40 40 40 49 49 49 40
this right at the beginning	71 70 70 70 71
who joins and who joins us inside	49 49 79 79 79 79 79
fun down in the comments below let me	64 40 64 67 67 67 67 68
house by a lot so this brings me to the	79 79 79 79 79 49 19 19 19 19
I ' ll just grab this from my nightstand	43 43 43 43 40 40 40 40 67
before going in now cold reads are not	67 41 71 71 49 76 76 71
than it actually did	70 70 80 80
And what I read in this book	76 76 79 79 79 79 79
movie or making the show	67 67 70 70 67
playing in the nba so	41 41 41 41 41
and everything that I ' ve done that is a	0 0 19 0 0 0 19 19 1 10
as much commission from you when you do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
as i mentioned so many times before in	79 79 79 79 71 71 71 71
have complete control	79 79 41
You know like old	70 70 70 70
the time in real life don ' t we	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
when i was a younger kid even in my	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
booked me off of my audition for that	79 79 76 73 73 73 73 73
less than 20 % down and like I said	79 79 79 79 79 79 43 80 80
and manually going through them	67 67 49 49 50
definitely don ' t want to do that so how	43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43
think that is very necessary my personal	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
investment or rental property if you	40 61 61 34 61 31
I would love it if you hit that like	70 67 44 68 68 68 68 68 71
is your job as an actor because we can	71 41 71 71 71 49 79 79 50
picture everything going on in that restaurant in your mind ' s eye	41 71 41 49 49 49 49 19 19 19 19 19 41
And final piece of advice if you ' re in the UK	52 52 52 52 52 43 43 43 43 43 43 43
I was at a callback for a movie and the	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 77 77
scale I ' m sorry I ' m going on a tangent	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
and i was able to kind of push through	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
website templates on so if you	79 79 79 79 79 79
and then	71 71
flooring to new porcelain tiles	70 52 52 71 79
and years down the line	67 71 71 71 71
It ' s just kind of in life in general	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
the mid markets will probably all have	71 80 53 53 53 53 80
that really resonated with me was that	50 51 52 52 52 52 25
you have to complete and pass and at the	67 67 67 67 67 40 49 49 40
this template	71 76

in filmmaking it ' s happened to me before	70 41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71
not always but it is a system that if	52 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 40
Yeah thanks for watching	76 76 78 78
top three or top five	43 70 70 70 70
many factors but i ' ll tell you what in	79 77 77 80 80 80 80 80 71 71
it down onto my notebook so a few years	49 49 49 40 40 49 49 49 49
your lender and if it shows that you do	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
right for this particular role but we	80 80 80 80 76 76 76
of a chat those are the conversations that compound	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
paid over a thousand dollars for	77 77 77 80 80 77
percent of the loan amount generally	0 0 0 0 0 0
awesome right yeah trying to save paper	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of something called active recall and spaced repetition	76 79 76 79 79 79 79 79
thing that you have is your name and big	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the lines off the page by yourself all	71 71 71 41 41 71 71 79
delivering the other lines who	76 76 76 76 76
countries and what casting platforms are	40 40 40 41 41 41
you are still the biggest stakeholder in	68 71 71 71 71 71 71
just so hard to come up with 20 % down	0 0 0 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
my youtube videos and my course content	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
besides the money part there are tons of	40 52 52 53 41 40 40 40
you are buying a part ownership	22 49 40 58 31 61
for instance then i would have to pay	68 40 49 50 50 50 50 50
to seem a little bit scammy about how	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
not work in another and this has a lot	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 79 79
and the whole escrow process once you do	40 40 40 41 40 40 40 40
yourself at home	41 40 40
or saving money for example let ' s talk	79 79 79 71 70 79 79 79 43

if you can learn to have fun journey before destination	41 41 41 50 50 41 50 49 49 46
but if you ' re one of the other 99 of	41 68 71 71 71 71 71 41 41 49 79
even though I had just personally	41 44 44 67 67 41
in pretty much every major city in	40 43 70 70 70 70 70
into this	41 71
that they use that audition to	26 53 53 80 53 37
represent me	79 71
student films and independent films and	71 71 71 71 40 49
life and over time if you do this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once you ' ve hit those landmarks	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
then you also have to pay 1 . 5 percent	50 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
we have four units total so i ' m gonna	11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11
video I ' ll have links on there to some	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
about immigration so you ' ll have to	71 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
impossible to take those next steps	70 79 67 67 70 70
previous steps and have	76 79 79 79
agent i grabbed my headshot and resume	71 52 52 52 79 79 67
So on YouTube if you had 62 , 000 subscribers	67 76 67 70 67 68 59 59 59 63
asset and then sell it for more later on	11 19 19 19 19 20 20 19 19
you ' re also going to get demo reel	80 80 80 76 77 77 77 79 79
down I heard him say first team	68 68 80 80 76 73 73
but obviously like again money is an exchange of value	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
strategy to pass the salesperson brokers	70 79 79 79 79 79
percent and there are some more little	31 31 40 40 40 31 31
running the line so you ' re gonna do this	68 68 40 40 40 40 40 67 70 70
Grail and Holy Grail is level to expert	52 41 49 49 49 49 50 50
I was like " Ehh everyone ' s kinda shy ."	40 70 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
Health Service this is the video I wish	74 74 74 74 65 74 65 77
take this seriously	71 71 71
strictly pursuing theater as their main	31 58 67 67 68 67
a reason why most people just never	49 49 49 49 49 41 71
that ' s gonna be 90 % so be lower the down	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 70 70 80 71
examinations pay for maybe a realtor	79 79 80 80 80 80
anybody in this industry	50 50 50 50
before you can expect anything in return	58 58 58 58 58 58 58
professional headshot can cost	41 41 41 41
that was the time to do it so i feel	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 52 52
you ' re going to say how can i have	68 68 68 68 68 71 71 71 68 68
score i ' ve made other videos about this	71 40 40 40 41 41 44 40 40

that stuff is absolutely not gonna stick in the longterm	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 76
new york and atlanta	71 71 71 68
matter if you ' re a personal brand or a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

when it came time for them to cast	80 80 80 80 77 50 50 71
getting started and if you have	70 71 71 67 67 49
those roles in movies and shows and	71 71 49 79 79 49 49

was all focused on passive income and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

the acting career center here to help	71 71 71 71 68 68 68
exam plus	41 41
Lane and we know in the days that were	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
those reasons alleged child had heard	43 49 70 71 71 71
uh chicago new york atlanta and some of	44 41 41 41 71 71 71 71
last 29 . 5 years so let ' s say on that 500	31 31 31 31 58 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
harder it is to sell in the future you	1 1 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you have	76 76
document and you can follow along as i	76 76 73 76 76 76 76 76
cobra kai is the best show you will	21 21 20 20 20 20 20 20
and it doesn ' t have a physical button	41 41 41 41 41 41 68 68 68
and staple it to the back when you are	77 76 79 79 80 80 80 80 80
projects from that day	70 67 64 67

Point number 15	71 59 59
which I hadn ' t done in my first year	77 77 71 71 71 70 70 70 70 70
questions and they also	40 49 22 40
this industry is it depends	79 79 79 49 68
you learn the skills you need to break	68 68 69 72 72 72 72 72
and that also contributes to my productivity	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is because in the UK over half of the cars that are bought	51 51 51 51 51 78 51 54 54 51 51 51 51

as a background actor because now you	67 67 67 49 49 49 73
think if you ' re a product business no	49 40 68 68 68 68 76 49 49

then let me tell you this i think there	79 79 79 79 79 80 50 50 80
stuff because that ' s the stuff that we	49 49 50 50 50 50 49 49 49
fulfillment and meaning and all that	70 67 67 67 67 67
movie i have no doubt that those three	41 41 41 40 40 41 80 80
those types of things are great to start	80 80 77 77 68 71 71 71
in a few months and chances are you	79 79 79 61 70 79 79 79
first and last name in the name of the	71 71 71 41 50 50 41 71 71
because of all of those other things	53 26 26 26 26 26 26
do prioritize union actors over nine	67 67 50 71 71 71
you simply because	0 0 0
what ' s up my fellow actors welcome to	49 49 49 49 49 41 41 71 71
perfectly over time by just flooding the	76 50 50 49 49 49 40
set and hey there was sean penn	49 41 71 71 71 71 71
having a monetizable skill is not an	76 76 79 79 3 0 21
like hey this is how you can use your	49 49 49 50 49 49 50 41 41
happens a lot in this industry anything	71 71 68 68 67 67 40
And one of the main things about investing for the longterm	80 80 71 71 49 49 76 79 52 49 70
i ' m here in atlanta a medical school	71 71 71 71 71 77 68 77 80
afford it so even though finances might	79 79 79 79 79 79 71
elementary school	0 0
that you could potentially rent out some	19 19 19 20 20 19 19
they ' ve already started	67 67 67 64 41
and because Apple are feeling kind	58 31 58 64 64 67
until four or five in the morning	79 71 79 79 79 79 79
And so what I try and do now is that every now and then	53 44 71 77 76 70 70 70 79 70 61 61 61 61
like i said i ' ve done a bunch of these	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 79 71
to break into the film and television	41 41 41 71 71 71 71
instead of writing that you could write	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh and feel free to share with anyone	71 76 62 71 71 71 79 79
so let ' s go ahead and talk about the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of getting a brand new Tesla Model 3	0 0 21 0 0 0 0 0
your control and it can be really	40 76 40 40 40 40 67
than performing a monologue look it just	40 50 41 71 50 50 50
better and a lot more interesting on	79 79 76 79 76 79 79
voice over actor in commercials voice	79 79 71 71 49 52
and be this piece of clay maybe not so	33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
that can make your house purchase go	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
i . e this work equals suffering approach to life	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
already using one or you show it then	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
summary of your whole	40 40 40 40
or compete with your year group	70 70 70 70 74 80
the lower an interest rate that they are	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
or not they should get a degree	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
now I ' m not telling you this to	71 68 68 68 68 62 62 62 62
that I ' ve done has been sort of very hodgepodge	52 52 52 52 76 76 70 70 70 70 70
Like you know when we ' re doing stuff that we enjoy	79 79 70 70 49 49 49 49 49 79 79 79
because joining the union is a very	50 70 70 70 40 40 43
and medians you know if you perform much	79 79 52 52 52 52 79 79
because of the way that i was created	49 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
name is Kurt you thank you so much for	77 77 50 41 76 76 80 80 80
needs to be made	79 79 79 71
it ' s very similar to buying a car	43 43 43 70 62 61 61 62 43
think it ' s needed so in this section i	70 79 79 79 43 70 70 70 70 40
constantly doing different things as a	40 76 40 40 40 40
ever asked me to do a monologue who	79 80 41 41 44 71 50 49
And back in the day a stockbroker was a physical person	31 31 31 31 67 70 70 70 40 40 31
and in year five last year	58 58 58 58 58 58
where you will definitely need to pursue	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
real estate	31 31
should be the same way you know because	49 49 49 46 46 49 49 49
owning it protecting it worrying about	67 67 67 70 70 70
days prior to prepare that audition	80 51 51 77 49 67
kind of long distance skier called Tim Peck	79 79 79 79 79 76 76 79
a fast bad wrong thing than that thing that	71 80 67 67 71 43 70 58 58
is the role of sponsors	40 41 68 67 68
ourselves so much that you know were	49 49 49 49 22 19 19
so three weeks later they brought me	76 76 76 76 76 76 76
To use a friend of mine as an example	34 52 52 52 52 43 34 34 34
and i want to tell you guys that i don	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
relationships and you know most people	40 40 31 31 31 31
and that introduces some concepts to you	76 76 40 67 67 46 37
interest rates down payment and all	40 40 40 40 43 53
but there just wasn ' t a lot of film and	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 80 80 80 80
without doing the things there that	79 70 79 70 79 79
take my dog there all the time to hike	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
for thinking about the question	50 50 50 49 49
so grateful for you guys	71 71 71 44 79
built and so my first web site that I	49 76 76 67 28 37 37 37 37
you don ' t need that right away i think	70 67 67 67 64 67 67 64 67 67
am I more confident am i lifting more	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51
necessary here ' s my advice	79 79 79 79 79 49
conventional loans is that you can get	79 79 70 79 79 79 79
normally do but you know I ' ve shot	0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
when you ' re investing in stocks and shares	0 0 0 0 19 49 49 79 79
agent you ' re submitting to	80 80 80 80 76 76
probably going to be a little bit better	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 31
as you can see we ' re not in my normal	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70
working in plays working in student	79 79 79 79 79 79
goals and make sure it ' s something you	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
myself again i want to do the things	79 49 79 79 79 79 79 79
you might have some web series and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
up on my third line so if you could just	52 52 79 79 79 79 70 70 79 76
certain areas perhaps I work out in this	49 49 49 49 40 40 40 40
into having a big house and think about	80 79 79 79 79 43 41 43
lenders are taking on by lending you	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
one and your two is your end mark so if	53 53 80 53 80 80 71 68 68 68
there ' s plenty of stuff that you should	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
opportunity for you another Pro is that	68 40 40 67 70 67 67
extremely low	79 79
that ' s just because more people like	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in the on camera acting realm one fun	71 71 71 71 71 50 41 41
or you could park an rv on your lot and	20 20 21 20 21 0 1 19 19 19
increases for	31 40
unfortunately i can ' t answer those	52 49 52 52 52 79 52
across from them and saying the	76 67 67 76 76 76
little girl was the very talented Navia	77 77 77 76 79 79 79
have callbacks sometimes they will	79 79 76 79 77
change the baseboards and add some crown	79 79 80 79 79 25 25
every single week now today ' s video is	49 41 41 41 52 52 52 49 49
which has been really helping on that front	50 77 50 49 49 70 70 67
sort of me the same but you know some of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79 79
really used so much	71 71 71 71
that city isn ' t a major acting market	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
in all areas the tenth and final way to	41 50 40 41 41 41 41 49 49
And as you know at this point	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
each and every day every day you need to	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
live in one of those bedrooms so if i	76 76 50 79 79 79 52 79 79
actually read the information and you	40 67 67 70 70 49
most people are not going to be able to	31 40 40 40 31 40 40 31 40
this for you you don ' t need someone to	53 53 26 26 53 53 53 80 80 53
where the mantra for the whole year was GOHIO	67 41 68 41 41 68 68 68 67

right way	70 71
I ' m glad you asked because	49 49 49 49 49 49 46
and stuff like that like I do to an	19 19 0 81 41 41 50 50 80
not for casting purposes but for kind of	70 70 41 41 31 40 40 40
and not be able to pay your bills so you	40 49 49 49 49 52 52 52 70 70
another thing that you won ' t have to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49 79
a better actor	79 79 80
have a bookshelf that	49 40 49 49

much we get to sleep and so especially	40 40 40 40 40 40 49 49
gives me much more to work with and	80 80 52 52 49 49 50 41
days for a reason because knowin is	40 40 40 40 49 49 49
sorting out the project management software	70 70 70 76 79 79
to Starbucks but maybe it ' s a day where	42 50 50 50 41 41 41 50 50 50
that you want to be a professional	67 67 67 67 67 67 71
But that idea when someone comes across it	52 52 79 67 67 67 67 67

on your resume like this if you were the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

many different	50 41
a ton of commercial print modeling in my	79 68 71 71 68 71 71 68
then i expect them to have a	41 40 40 40 40 40 37
to overcompensate for potentially bad	77 79 79 80 80
class even better but learn how to	71 71 41 50 50 51 51
but we can control how we come off as a	68 68 71 68 50 80 50 50 41 71
together like a well - oiled machine	44 50 67 41 41 41 41

take attention away from you	77 77 77 77 77
Just like share openly	79 79 79 79
very consistently	58 58
search for those groups	79 70 70 70
time that you submit for	53 53 80 80 71
don ' t have a	79 79 79 79 79
major markets like new york or los	43 43 40 43 40 49 49
Because further down the line like at the start	52 52 79 79 52 52 52 52 43
producer sessions and network tests and	80 76 79 76 80 80
days is they like to make it an	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49

my take when it comes to using props	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
then brings back	67 67 71
make sure to go to acting career center	68 68 68 68 68 71 71 71

commissioned this study which was an analysis	79 79 67 64 67 67 67
You ' re gonna do a pretty good job of putting yourself	1 1 1 1 10 1 1 1 49 79 79 76

need to hire a casting director this is	67 64 70 70 70 67 67 67
through what these 12 things are	40 40 40 70 70 70
and investing in index funds	49 76 79 49 76
And how hard can it be	70 79 79 79 52 79
travel costs they have to pay for a	70 49 68 68 68 68 68 68
within your price range	79 79 79 79
It ' s actually very hard to make compelling YouTube videos	67 67 67 67 58 67 67 67 67 68 68
And then you can invest that in the S & amp ; P 500	79 79 70 70 67 67 70 70 67 67 67 67 67 67
few free hours during the day you can	3 3 40 40 40 49 49 40
so those were all of the costs that i	71 71 71 70 70 70 71 68 41

up just keep looking keep looking and	40 40 40 40 41 40 40
or one of the best ways of making passive income	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
the ways that they ask these questions	79 79 70 79 79 79 79

and you could of risk with me on the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
I just worked myself up and my mindset was approaching this	61 61 61 61 61 61 61 62 62 62 62
And the first one is FBR which stands for fast bad wrong	67 64 64 64 67 67 67 67 70 70 70 70
when I first had my first part time job	31 31 58 31 31 31 41 71 49
literally learn anything online and then	50 50 50 49 73 73
now i want to emphasize again that if	49 49 41 41 41 41 37 37
guarantee you that that is completely	79 79 79 79 79 79
gotten a chance to work on a lot of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that anyone can promise you if they do	53 53 49 49 49 67 67 67
tech on social media and we can really	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
have your own company you are working	40 40 40 49 40 40 40
is really helpful because I don ' t have	40 67 67 40 40 40 40 40 79
all right we ' ve all heard it ' s normal	79 79 79 79 79 79 71 71 71 71 79

15 years ahead in your career right now	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
off of your paycheck this is great	53 44 44 44 49 49 49
if the director likes you know a certain	33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
And she found that her videos that are over 10 minutes	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49
In fact this whole video is so long	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
put in the work and proven themselves	76 76 76 76 76 76 76
found this video helpful please spread	79 79 79 79 79 79
and give it a thumbs up	77 77 79 79 41 41
and also from a YouTube algorithm perspective	40 40 41 41 41 0 0
the same director the same company was	41 49 41 40 49 49 49
meaning fulfillment enjoyment all of that sort of stuff	77 73 78 78 78 77 74 73 76
if you live in miami now there are pros	79 79 79 71 49 41 41 41 41
and the money that you should have saved	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
this is pretty good	53 53 53 53
And since that time	70 70 67 67
musical theater actor	80 71 71
be a better option or even	53 53 53 80 53 80
i am a plumber she goes on to make the	79 79 79 79 40 49 76 76 76 76
say hire someone it ' s really important	31 61 31 31 31 31 31 31
you get all these acronyms being thrown around	76 49 52 70 71 80 80 53
and the yale school of drama i ' m pretty	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
everyday lives if we see that brand	61 61 58 61 61 61 61
you become eligible immediately another	40 40 43 41 71
So in my fifth year of med school	67 46 46 67 67 67 67 67
because it ' s actually very very easy	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
opportunities here that ' s incorrect	71 52 79 79 79 79
the idea of	79 79 79
make it harder for the producers to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your house and to do that you ' re gonna	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
gains i could talk about this for	31 31 31 31 31 31 31
some point	71 71
in cash basically three to six months of living expenses	71 71 71 70 71 71 71 70 49 79
But the good news is once you ' ve created it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
what these types of videos are similar	49 50 50 50 50 50 50
and get experience that way by doing	71 71 41 41 43 43 71
We had a bit of takeaway	51 0 0 51 51 51
have to go on some actual auditions to	68 71 68 71 71 71 71 70
renovations that ' s people that came to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 52
mortgage payment is just going back into	79 79 79 79 70 79 79
because it was making me a significant amount of money	67 67 67 67 67 67 68 68 64 65
is here to make sure that actors are	70 70 70 70 70 40 70 70
auditions when you are non	80 80 80 77 73
a whopping 1825	70 70 71
and I find that that ' s really helpful	73 76 76 76 64 64 64 64 64
You would need 8 , 000 visits to your website	58 58 58 58 58 58 49 49 49 41
like what just happened and how long you	19 19 19 19 19 50 50 41
really helps because you ' re not just	41 41 41 41 41 41 40 41
go check out that video but maybe	70 68 71 71 79 79 67
with double - sided tape however you put	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
adaptation to create a stimulus so that	41 41 41 41 41 41 49
liquid savings account alright the third	41 44 53 40 40 44
getting late auditions quite frequently	76 76 80 49 49
if you ' re willing to do all those things	51 54 54 54 54 81 51 41 71 71

to its fullest capacity or at least in a	40 40 40 49 40 40 40 40 40
casting networks	79 79
good thing because it means you have	67 70 67 67 70 70 70
with money	13 13
there ' s the index bit and the fund bit	76 76 76 76 40 40 23 50 50 50

you walk out the door and you left them	67 68 68 68 65 68 68 68 68
in the united states if you don ' t have	49 49 49 40 40 40 40 40 40 40

typical nine - to - five job to build those	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 49 49 49
Again this sort of depends on	49 49 49 40 41 41
an aesthetic you ' re going for and you	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
probably a little bit easier to become	49 49 76 76 40 19 76
might get better scenes than what you	76 76 76 40 40 40 40
from there and you	71 41 49 49
closer to the source you can be the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
which i talked about in my video last	79 79 80 71 79 79 79 70

it pays three hundred dollars and it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
we do that we first have to make sure	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
say you ' re spending x dollars and	28 28 28 28 31 55 58 31
So for example	79 79 79
are netflix and youtube premium and	70 67 71 79 40 49
your name should be printed somewhere in	49 76 76 76 76 76 49

they ' re not eating the same things	37 37 37 37 37 37 37 37

watching this with say no to having an	53 53 53 53 80 80 77 80
so many questions	71 71 71
classes for cheaper than that	41 71 71 71 71
differences for sure but in general	50 50 77 68 80 77
scene they said okay now why don ' t you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
oddly shaped here but I think it works	0 0 49 49 76 70 70 79

that clears things up as to how much an	49 41 41 41 40 40 40 40 43
unless you already live in one of the	44 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
yesterday with a couple other actors and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
um all right so that ' s it for this video	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 79
after you ' ve gotten to the point where	43 70 70 70 71 67 67 67 67
it a business	41 41 71
prioritize one over the other but i have	41 71 41 52 71 71 71 71
and you are	70 70 52
show set so once our number is called we	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 77
lead all the way down to all the	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
because there ' s loads and loads of online brokers instead	70 61 61 61 70 61 52 71 71 52 49
So within our famous side hustle assessment matrix	67 76 49 49 49 52 52 49
called tiny dinosaurs you would put it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
rest the more bedrooms the better your	79 79 79 79 52 79 79

you you ' ll see a lot of your friends	41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
and the stock market has different levels	62 58 58 58 58 58 58
and the reason why it ' s so important is	71 44 43 31 31 31 31 32 32 40
every single month they get hundreds of	50 50 49 49 76 40 67
now agents and managers do cost money	71 71 71 71 49 49 52
stronger choices than others or there	33 33 33 33 33 33
many of these projects are going to be	79 79 79 53 80 80 80 80
And finally point number 12 is okay	40 71 53 53 71 71 43
talent agents aren ' t going to sign	41 70 79 79 79 79 49 40
And it ' s really great but it ' s very hard	40 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49

set all day some days we ' re working our	52 79 70 70 67 67 67 67 64 64
mentioned is it ' s only a 30 minute a day	32 32 31 31 31 28 28 37 37 37 37
as an example when i first got started	41 41 41 41 50 50 50 53
build up your client list as well as the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

how on Earth can running be fun	64 64 67 64 73 76 76
exactly the same so my point here isn	49 41 71 71 49 71 71 71
and then one day i get a call from my	50 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
you keep on looking at the price of the Apple stock	79 79 79 79 79 79 67 67 67 58 58
once we arrived on set and this happens	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

we only did that first sentence but like	70 70 70 43 41 71 71 71
So again I only really started doing this	70 70 70 40 40 40 70 71
you have to kind of take that concept a little bit further	71 67 67 67 67 67 70 70 70 67 67 67

local actors are not union	80 71 79 79 79
can just focus on what we ' ve talked	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
to get into movies and tv shows because	71 71 68 68 68 71 70 49
if this isn ' t nice I don ' t know what is	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 79 70 70
questions because i ' ve never lived in	71 71 49 49 49 49 49 49
yes i really want to be an actor and i	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
something athletic to your audition but	79 1 14 14 14 14
submissions from all kinds of crazy	71 79 79 79 79 79
are a real estate agent then sadly no	79 79 70 79 79 79 79 79
audition class i highly	71 41 41 71
serious about it and i ' m really good and	50 77 77 77 77 77 77 80 80 80
the same thing	71 71 71
so they decided okay we can ' t consider	49 49 77 49 40 40 40 40 40
wasn ' t auditioning for film and tv so it	52 52 52 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
outsource more because you ' ll actually	79 79 79 79 79 79 52
But the point here is that	79 70 70 70 70 61
mention here that i didn ' t hire anyone	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in Final Cut and after working through	52 79 43 43 52 52 52
the audition can be live and in person	70 70 67 70 71 71 70 67
that ' s going to be a very personal	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
compare buying it with other properties	31 31 31 58 61 61
yourself uh	71 71
and i wanted to share a story from	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
few decades and as a result	44 53 53 40 40 44
investing in entrepreneurship so that	41 41 41 41 40
when he was 16 to go to medical school	81 71 70 79 52 79 79 70 70
and you ' ll save some money that way also	40 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 40
photos or	67 67
whatever city you live in right now even	79 79 79 79 49 70 71 79
consider donating them consider selling	41 41 41 41 40
I think he uses Notion to manage and track his own startup	70 70 70 67 67 67 64 64 67 67 67 67
about the audition process	50 53 80 80
exactly what to say because this is a	80 80 71 71 71 52 49 49
important piece	76 76
to help me my business and i didn ' t even	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
full - blown police officer ' s uniform with	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 52 52
take on the perspective of how much it	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
ever have PMI for the entire third year	71 71 70 68 70 67 67 70
single job	76 79
your scene tomorrow instead	70 70 70 79
whole your finances and what you need to	76 79 79 76 79 79 79 79
So point number four is what is an investment	67 67 67 67 67 52 53 53 50
10 or so years all right number five on	70 70 70 70 71 43 16 70 70
So thanks to corporation tax first and dividend tax second	79 81 81 79 79 80 79 79 79 79
know billing for me on this side I	33 33 33 33 33 32 32 32
the only time you pay your agent is	52 49 50 50 50 50 50 50
take quite a big cut from you for	61 61 79 79 79 79 79 79
So don ' t try and summarize your lecture notes	81 81 81 81 81 81 81 81 81 81
and 4 , 000 hours of watch time	76 79 79 79 76 79 76 76
but you ' re only doing one and you	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
University is gonna be the best time of your life	65 65 68 68 68 68 77 77 68 68
you ' re seeing current information so	71 71 71 71 71 71 40
When you go to a new place you probably know	79 79 79 79 79 68 77 80 80 80
tells me that i	79 79 79 76
should also be submitting	71 71 79 79
000 after living there for two years the	20 10 20 19 19 20 20 20
incredibly helpful as well so	79 79 79 79 80
know basis if you don ' t need to know	41 49 49 49 52 52 52 49 49 49
painting some cabinets doing some	1 0 0 0 0
how to use their bodies from a	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
in high school or college or community	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
up until six in the morning	77 77 77 77 41 77
on acting in theater and	41 41 41 41 50
and yet that movie was not filmed in	41 41 41 41 41 71 71 71
the chances that I will book my audition	49 49 49 49 40 40 40 40
monologues suck	41 44
sometimes is	79 79
started with people in real life I	20 19 10 10 10 10 1
stuff added up together that is why	31 31 31 40 40 40 40
your property there ' s a lot of prep	71 71 41 41 41 44 49 52 41
these five tips these are the things	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you are the type of person who	71 41 41 41 41 68 71 71
for a community - like service for this	50 40 46 46 46 49 52 52
instead they ' re moving all their stuff	40 49 49 49 49 49 49 40
and that can draw lots of attention yeah	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
so here are six steps that you can take	79 79 40 70 70 67 67 67 67
i got as soon as i moved to a major	67 67 71 70 67 67 71 71 71 71
basically all of my investments all of my money	79 79 79 76 79 77 77 67 79
or running a supervision for my students	70 79 79 79 70 52 79
and I think oh actually this is kind of reasonable	40 40 40 44 44 49 49 49 49 52
also need to consider that it ' s probably	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you know there ' s just there ' s so many	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
also being and deception lasting dry	71 68 71 71 71 71
And so with me for example	76 76 76 76 79 79
we in the industry don ' t need to hear	49 49 80 80 49 49 49 49 79 79
description below	80 77
like how to join when to join whether or	80 76 76 71 67 71 71 49 52
first one	71 71
it ' s a lot of work you have to	0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
section and then i write	0 0 0 0 0
looking for and	80 80 80
before they can try to get to play into	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
acting classes are so vital to your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
groups you can start looking for	70 79 49 79 79 79
You just genuinely have to have something	40 49 49 49 49 49 49
is to start a podcast	52 52 52 52 52
takeaways that i think	49 49 49 49
schedules change all the time	43 68 68 41 41
Equally we ' re gonna give it a four out of five - star rating	79 70 70 70 79 79 79 79 52 71 62 63 63 63 62
even though kurt can ' t make the actual	77 74 77 76 76 76 76 76 77
there is almost no way your future self	71 80 80 79 79 79 79 79
money like they had a good amount of it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
the only difference you can tell is that	44 52 52 43 41 71 71 70
you basically live in one of the units	31 31 40 40 40 40 40 31
go to their website 48hourfilm . com i ' ll	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
description may have been written when	79 52 52 52 52 79
he was someone that everybody knew now	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
network or streaming service moving on	0 0 0 0 0 0
agents I talked about it they had my	41 50 50 50 50 50 50 41
the data be not show you the complete	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
And I wish I ' d corrected this eight years ago	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
I see they ' re super low and you have to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
industry rather than for consumption by	49 49 19 46 49 49
and they would use that audition to cast	79 79 52 52 52 70 52 79
doesn ' t take as much time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
of my career personally i ' m currently	41 41 41 49 41 41 41 41
Point number 11	70 79 52
to make a significant amount of money for Patreon	40 49 41 49 49 49 49 49 49
right out of frame so when the auditions starts	71 71 71 71 70 80 80 79 79
that ' s the cost of borrowing the money	71 71 71 70 76 76 79 40 79
even know what would happen yeah I just	71 71 70 70 70 70 70 70
writing in the middle of it	79 79 79 79 80 79
want so if we drag it all the way now we	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
much routine as possible however in the	41 41 40 40 41 41 41
in a savings account right now	52 52 52 79 68 67
which is a tripod for vloggers it	50 50 50 49 49 49 50
all the way through to machine learning algorithms	71 71 71 67 67 67 68 68
that we see in our YouTube Studio these are so important	67 67 40 40 40 31 31 40 49 70 40
obviously there are a ton of actors who	40 40 67 67 67 67 40 40
because I can ' t handle these losses	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
spending some time here with me today if	70 70 71 70 70 70 70 71
did you know that just about every major	77 68 68 68 50 50 49 49
wasn ' t a part of the I mean it was in	29 29 29 32 32 29 29 29 32 32 32 32
building that relationship and think	79 79 79 76 76
little bit but i also understood that	76 79 76 76 79 79 79
what i mean by this is	40 40 40 40 40 40
actually selling the watch and we	76 73 73 76 76 76
most of that stuff will not show up in	41 40 40 40 22 49 49 49 49
because it ' s gonna cause you undue	43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43
cashless and this is becoming more	40 40 40 61 61 61
person right	79 79
oh that was actually a really good day	43 52 52 52 52 52 43 79
okay but now let me talk about a couple	50 41 40 40 40 50 80 80 80
out it ' d be at some really cheap place	70 79 79 79 70 70 61 61 79 79
your acting ability is and if you can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
oh I don ' t know is that really enough to	40 37 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
thus have the best opportunity to get	40 70 49 50 50 81 50
and the projects that are filming in	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the extended warranty option extended	79 79 71 70 67
really depends on the lender that you go	31 40 40 40 67 40 40 40
There ' s nothing sexy or exciting about it	67 67 67 44 49 49 41 44 44
pursue a photography business no matter	79 79 79 79 79 70
content consistently over a long period of time	67 52 40 79 52 25 25 25
value then it just doesn ' t make sense	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
this industry but similar to	71 71 67 70 41
fees every time that you	67 67 67 67 67
maybe take my shirt off to make it more	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
especially now where	41 71 50
out from all the reading in your real	76 49 49 49 40 76 40 40
So let ' s say I want us to take out	79 79 79 79 80 81 80 81 81 79 79
and you ' ve prepared for this audition to	50 80 80 80 50 50 50 50 80
Thursday I have I have a job coming up	46 46 46 46 37 46 46 46 46
are available on Skillshare	77 71 79 79
it because we never use that function a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that mastermind opened my eyes to so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
how do you get your license and then how	40 37 37 40 40 40 67 67 31
may put on	41 41 49
process that ' s helping me book many	80 80 80 80 50 41 41 79
again so I found doing this to be really	40 71 40 40 41 44 71 71 71
already which was great and once again i	71 49 49 49 76 76 76 67
tons of film competitions	49 49 41 71
to a free trial of Skillshare	55 58 58 58 58 58
people to hit that link will get 20	70 70 70 70 67 70 70 70
of these things have a one - time cost of	10 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10
really cool how this works what it	71 71 71 71 71 40 41
are willing to pay for that skill	46 37 37 64 64 67 64
Now I actually considered applying	71 71 71 53 41
is when you get paid so if you make a	67 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67
taping commandment number nine is to	1 1 1 0 0 0
quite passionate on house hacking and i	79 79 70 70 49 49 49
another really great resource that you	41 41 44 40 41 41
there for free but the whole point is	70 70 43 49 40 40 40 40
to record remote podcast interviews	58 59 59 58 49
have had different experiences than i	50 50 70 70 70 71
extremely hard	52 23
action as soon as you can because in the	80 80 79 79 79 49 79 79 79
real estate brokerage from there you	67 67 76 49 40 31
real estate broker you can ' t buy or sell	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 80 71 71
So pretty easy to start	40 49 49 22 20
if they do their tax rate is going to be	31 31 31 28 31 31 31 31 31 31
fantastic scene for a demo reel	80 80 80 71 71 49
can do is become an authorized user	40 41 41 41 41 41 40
i ' m actually extremely grateful that i	67 67 67 67 68 68 64 64
you know be behind the scenes and	71 71 71 50 50 41 50
inside of this house kind of going	79 79 43 43 52 79 52
need in one year in three or four months	41 50 50 41 49 49 49 41 50
level 3 comes in level 3 is when we	49 76 76 76 76 49 49 76 67
So if that sounds up your street	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
everyone you just need to know what it is that you	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
play here or there	79 79 79 79
And so when I would make my revision timetables	49 49 49 49 49 49 40 40 40
Again it ' s one of those things where the individual event	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
is also used by the agent when they are	41 80 71 80 50 40 40 70 71
just anything that shows your income is	40 41 40 40 41 41 41
especially if you can find the right	20 20 19 19 19 19 19
and you have booked the room because if	71 71 71 71 71 68 68 41
throwing money away buying these	70 70 70 40 49
I wanna be doing for the next weeks or the next month	49 49 44 41 41 44 43 49 49 41 41 41
that up to you	0 0 0 0
they can trust	71 71 71
put under twenty percent down for a	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
Right so how hard is it to start a podcast	58 67 49 49 49 49 49 52 49 49
The process of making the account	41 41 41 41 41 52
atlanta right so like i said this is a	49 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
we ' re not going to stick to it word for	41 41 41 40 40 40 40 68 68 68 50
uh it ' s something that ' s broadcast on tv	26 26 26 26 26 53 53 53 53 53 53
for like nine months at this point	32 32 32 32 32 32 32
i know you ' re one of the few that do	52 43 70 70 70 70 79 79 79 79 79
and yeah the way that they ask things	49 13 19 40 50 41 41 40
drive to starbucks and you can make	70 70 70 70 71 71 71
what do you do well you should create it	79 79 79 79 80 50 50 50 52
It ' s actually quite hard to get 8 , 000 visits per month	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 46 49 49 49 49 49 50
know there ' s no way to go back in time	49 49 49 49 51 51 51 51 50 50 41
recognize that up until 2 : 00 AM those Hangouts are useful	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 77 79
switching from your name is worn so many	11 11 10 4 31 31 40 70
exact scenario happened to me in 2017	80 80 77 77 76 79 79
audition in late if you turn your	79 79 79 79 49 73 79
the industry who makes decisions who can	49 49 49 49 70 40 40
show them don ' t tell them that you	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
anymore sister to sleep with hands with	68 74 50 41 71 79 71
partial list if you look over at my	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
marketing around here especially	79 79 79 79
or whatever it was	71 71 71 71
I should be 2 pounds less and it ' s like	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
people viewing maybe 10 homes 20 homes	40 41 41 40 41 41 40

available upon	0 0
at the callback who was wearing a	76 76 76 76 76 49 49
headshot of you	67 67 41
they all allow you to do the same thing	77 80 71 71 71 71 71 79 76
included on different pages that her	79 79 79 79 79 77
of actually finding value at properties	31 40 40 40 40 31
and now the only light that ' s on is the	73 73 73 73 73 73 73 73 64 64 73
remember exactly what was written it	70 70 70 70 70 79
And so he spends proportionally less	67 71 71 67 76 67
of s corpse is that they allow you to	31 31 31 31 31 31 43 43 52
use that because they all have hd	40 40 71 71 71 71 71
description below the next thing that	40 40 40 40 40 40
then i just don ' t know how useful	41 50 49 52 52 52 53 53 68
body starts shaking you ' re like what	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
happened to movie stars	71 71 71 71

virtual and email has been very	76 68 68 41 68 68
help you see success much faster the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

entire audition script I find that this	71 41 41 40 40 40 40
had long hair okay	49 46 46 46
put it in perspective of other jobs if i	71 71 67 70 71 50 41 41 68
you know who follow my channel	71 71 71 71 71 50
lot more strength workouts and so I need	40 40 40 37 40 20 23 23
atlanta which doesn ' t quite	71 42 79 79 79 79
how does this work let ' s talk about that	0 0 0 40 49 49 49 49 49 49
real estate is that it can be very	40 40 40 49 40 40 40 40
means you would ' ve made $ 100 a month	61 61 61 61 61 62 44 44 32 28
through this about five or ten times	76 76 76 76 76 67 20
it is pretty scary not having money in	41 41 50 50 40 40 40 40
director in three years because of it I	41 41 50 50 50 50 50 49
two other actors using it to memorize	67 67 70 67 67 70 70
the day	68 68
and let ' s break down why	31 31 31 31 31 31 31
unlimited amounts of money then move	76 76 76 49 49 49
would have happened had i started at a	79 79 79 79 77 77 77 77
risk sometimes to invest if you know the	71 71 71 71 79 79 79 80
it you can combine tripods like these	0 0 50 50 50 50 50
should I dress for the character she	50 50 68 68 68 50 49
day are simply the pages of the script	49 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
like you might hire the same family	53 53 53 80 80 80 80
wedding photographer and i think it ' s a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
our life energy on this thing that we	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the bedroom should not be the focus of	40 40 40 40 40 68 71 71
learning and i hope to see you on set	71 67 71 71 71 71 71 71 0
number one is to follow the audition	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
or you did an in - person course they	40 40 40 13 49 49 49 49 40
if uh the production makes more money	67 67 67 67 67 67 67
really succeed you want to spend money	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your career in fact I want to give you	76 80 71 79 79 76 76 77 80
a point where you are the spokesperson	70 40 40 40 40 70 40
number two another reason why every	76 79 79 79 80 80
relatively new to acting I was going on	41 41 71 41 71 70 67 67
you will find that people are just generally nice	77 77 77 71 71 70 67 49 71
action and that somewhere between the	73 73 23 23 26 41
in that the end - user does not have to	41 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 49 49

valuable content on the Internet	37 40 49 49 49
background work for that show	51 81 81 71 71
charge you a lot less than a pro	71 68 68 68 68 68 71 71
now if that isn ' t within your budget if	80 80 71 79 79 79 49 79 40 41
then an email is going to be amazing for	79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76 49
three column format now i ' m going to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
If I ' m starting something new then I know it ' s gonna	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 50 49 76 49 49 49 73
And in fact in the UK historically in the past	67 67 67 67 64 67 67 40 49 79

And if you ' re putting a 60 - second ad in there	52 52 52 52 52 79 52 52 52 52 79 79 79
and that it comes from something else	79 79 70 70 70 70 70
and the callback was once again	71 71 71 41 49 49
film credits right so we ' re just going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
we have to make as actors you got to be	50 50 50 50 50 79 79 79 79 70
own business	71 71
other room that you can hear from where	26 26 26 26 26 26 43 40
lunch but I can ' t remember exactly which	49 49 40 40 40 40 37 37 37
saved up	79 79
many things that i just literally had no	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

under any circumstances try and sell it	79 79 76 31 31 31 31
sure to leave a like and also subscribe	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
know just going out there and buying	71 79 80 80 80 68 71
starting mark and we ' re gonna start that	76 73 76 76 76 76 76 79 79
can immediately get into a major	40 40 41 41 41 41
much as possible so having workflows for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
those public casting calls represent	80 71 71 71 80
agree with more if you like this video	77 77 77 77 77 74 73 76

check out those like little tiki hut BBQ	0 0 0 0 80 79 79 80
right from the get - go because they think	41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 76
let ' s say you want to put down 10 % using	70 70 70 70 70 70 79 79 70 79 79 70
or a quote or literally anything I ' m thinking of	76 76 67 76 70 53 76 76 76 73 64
you might have swing dance experience or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ideally we want the ongoing time	40 40 40 67 80 80
which is different to Canada and Germany and so on	49 71 71 71 71 71 80 80 80 71
film and then after that i got to work	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 41
i mean think about this imagine if a	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 68
has an amazing YouTube channel	67 70 70 44 71
schedules around that ' s why I recently	50 50 41 41 41 41 41 41
makes sense but	31 31 40
online you could very easily sign up to	50 41 41 41 53 26 19 0

of it I just want to ask you about how	49 49 49 49 49 22 49 49 49 49
agent this	0 0
but over the next few years my residual	67 67 37 67 67 67 64 67
Like I wouldn ' t get out a book and read it	49 49 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
using tape that ' s either in a form of an	68 76 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 14
auditions and it ' s used on set there	67 70 67 67 67 79 79 76 76
so when an employee gets hired by a	41 40 40 40 40 40 40 25
is using it but whereas a commercial	50 53 53 53 26 26 26
the agent will then tell the actor hey	67 67 64 69 81 68 74 69
and hit the link in the video description to get free access	71 70 70 79 79 80 76 76 76 76 76 79
and I get a Tesla that I can ride whenever I want	61 58 31 31 31 58 41 50 50 49 49 49
outside of the united states but you	80 80 80 80 80 80 80
on be more customized the house the	79 70 79 0 0 0 1
if it contributes to your business in	40 31 31 31 31 31 31

are you looking at their eyes 100 percent of the time when you ' re talking to them	80 80 71 80 71 71 71 50 44 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
Again I ' ve got a story for med school about this	65 64 64 64 64 64 64 67 67 67 67 67

the acting career center here to help	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
i mean like a real job you can ' t just	40 40 41 41 53 52 52 41 41 41 40
of people that receive an audition then	71 80 77 80 79 79 79
second thing that i ' ve invested a lot	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
taxed as a sole proprietorship however	31 40 40 31 31 40
doing is that you ' re slowly	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
would come down to the performers that	71 71 40 50 50 40 67
you can just be like	40 40 40 49 49
it it totally would make sense if that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
eating I like to call them lifestyles	41 40 40 40 40 40 41
advice now before we get started today i	71 41 49 49 79 79 79 79
sounds good you should head over to	53 26 26 53 53 53 53
and you know we	79 79 79 79
But if that number was gonna be $ 500 a month	67 67 67 67 67 64 64 64 64 64 67

my team really consisted of myself i had	79 79 80 79 79 79 79 79
and i drove	64 64 64
product thing it ' s something I ' m kind of	49 49 40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49 40
so yeah if you ' re thinking about getting	71 49 49 49 49 49 71 71 71
anything for two days and on the third	41 41 41 68 67 67 67 40
doubt myself because i know my	80 71 80 80 76 76

my experience and my advice	40 70 40 67 70
classes which brings up step number two	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
competition it ' s about getting involved	49 49 49 49 49 50 49
a studio that is based in hollywood that	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77
this earth to go to work so we can make	49 22 49 49 49 49 49 52 79 79
most medical schools will hire actors to	70 70 67 70 70 40 70
the biggest difference between a	71 50 80 50 50
to talk about this for a reason of	70 70 71 70 70 70 70 49
you ' re interested in joining the team	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
then squeeze out a little bit of extra productivity	49 49 79 49 49 79 41 49 49
we ' re not babysitters we are people who	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
so then i didn ' t hear anything for two	50 49 49 50 50 50 41 71 71 71
tell an engaging story then the people	68 67 68 68 68 67 68
or calculus if you ' re into maths	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
into a website template and creating a	77 77 77 77 77 77 77
this is the will of working and	68 68 68 68 67 67 41
going to be on that show until they	71 71 71 68 67 70 70 41
learn how to code through using Google	0 0 0 0 80 80 80
raise that camera too	76 73 73 73
and all that kind of stuff	41 41 40 31 31 31
casting director does not make	70 64 67 70 70
to build up a massive	40 41 41 41 40
auditions how i approach	71 40 40 58
because they were a cast and crew that	50 40 40 49 49 49 49 40
resources out there from YouTube to	79 79 79 79 79 79
under that section and maybe just next	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what ' s up my fellow actors welcome to	0 0 0 0 49 49 49 41 43
the right time for you	71 71 41 41 71
and use part of it to help renovate the	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67 40
taught actors to take the attention off	49 49 49 20 50 50 49
that just returns some amount of money each year	67 67 67 67 67 49 49 49 52
the interest rate you get is	40 40 40 40 40 40
and start	67 71
are my audition sites right here and	67 67 49 49 49 49 49
so that if you lose your job	79 71 71 77 67 43 79
of how the U . S economy is going as a whole	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
where i	53 53
some people will say that this should be	49 49 73 73 73 64 67 41
able to	79 79
the nine different ways ( icons pop )	79 79 49 49 41 41 41 41
And all that happened	52 52 25 25
all of this ends up happening in the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because of misleading ads it ' s the whole	0 0 0 0 70 70 70 70 70
twice as much alright another thing is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
network about a role that	73 73 76 76 76
to do with permit laws and rental rates	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
nail your audition every single time so	70 79 80 80 80 71 80
Because effectively you ' re getting all of this stuff	50 79 79 79 79 43 49 49 44 50
And then after your trial ends	53 49 49 52 52 43
the sort of productivity equation	61 58 58 58 58
If you just follow those three steps I guarantee	51 50 50 50 41 41 41 49 49
really visually appealing on the MLS so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
doing the show for eight seasons and	49 40 41 41 41 49 49
would argue that just as important is	40 40 67 68 71 71 68
jab is when you give someone content and	76 76 76 77 77 77 76 76
reality show rather than movie like the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of the Indie Hackers podcast which is really cool	49 49 19 19 19 19 19 49 46
that 6 . 5 % of my investments are in Apple 5 . 5 in Microsoft	79 76 76 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
help tell their story - I didn ' t talk	68 71 71 71 67 68 71 71 71 71
why i want you to get advice from as	71 71 41 41 50 49 79 49 50
atlanta georgia for example	41 41 41 40
for the money because something major has happened	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
where you ' re going to have to consider	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

Mountain people would be like oh my gosh	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
this stage in my business getting that	79 52 79 52 52 52 52
exactly what we were talking about	79 79 79 79 79 79
So that was a roundup of all the things	71 71 71 71 40 37 37 70 70
such that in March 2020 when she launched a membership	58 59 59 61 58 58 58 49 40 40
dividends also get taxed	51 73 73 73
and also the tent screening process you	32 40 40 40 40 40 40
our conversations look unscripted and spontaneous	41 41 41 49 41 41
more scratch resistant and waterproof	79 79 79 79 79
to add to my tool belt	79 79 79 71 41 41
Which means that at least for me	70 70 70 70 70 70 70

times higher now even though you might	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
can sometimes feel so let ' s break it	53 53 19 1 1 1 1 19 19
and that ' s the attention of people who	76 76 76 76 40 41 53 53 26
now getting represented by an agency	71 71 71 71 71 71
again independent films short films	49 71 41 50 80

kicking around and the process of	80 80 81 81 77 77
best if there were only water fills steps there	41 71 71 79 49 41 71 71 71
so fast you can ' t keep up with it so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76

who are willing to hear my message and	49 49 52 76 64 68 77 77
I remember this day when I turned on monetization	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

it to I want to eat this because I want	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
over the last 10 years	79 79 79 79 79
message that we don ' t know what we	52 41 49 52 52 52 49 52 52
cliches right so instead of someone	49 40 40 40 40 40
and you ' ll have an additional 25	31 31 31 31 31 31 64 67
let ' s say you ' re an actor who is doing	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70

your you know that ' s basically not going to happen	49 49 41 76 76 76 77 50 50 41 41
And for each of those I ' m gonna talk	49 49 49 49 40 67 67 67 76 76
how do you get experience how do you add	41 41 41 49 52 80 71 41 50
the project and depending on the role	76 70 70 67 67 67 67
end of every course you take a final	40 67 67 67 67 40 40 40
before you get hired to be a	73 73 73 76 73 73 76
afford it and they ' ll make large	79 79 71 71 71 71 79 70
This is 1500 pounds a month	33 41 0 0 0 32
especially like artists and makers and	79 79 52 79 79 79
that you can correct right now without	77 77 80 80 77 80 80
that we recorded through Skillshare live	64 64 64 41 41 50
actually pushed me forward and what when	79 79 76 79 79 79 79
oh I ' m not gonna share this idea	58 58 58 58 58 61 67 67 67
all care about value there ' s no snake	49 49 49 49 40 40 40 41 41
submitting to an agent the second way to	67 49 77 71 71 71 71 71
else and having them rehearse the lines	64 67 67 67 67 67 67
involving the actors yet this is	42 42 42 42 50 40
encourages you because if you ' re just	71 68 68 70 70 70 70 70
place for your long - term tenants	-89 0 -149 -179 -179 -179 -179
where you live again if you don ' t live	41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
down in that time period and even if	71 79 71 71 40 40 43 70
character but it ' s probably going	70 77 76 76 76 76 76
computer needs to be that same aspect	44 44 17 17 17 44 71
leads from somewhere like zillow or your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

and so when you say " Hey guys sign up to my Patreon	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 59 60 63 63 63 63
as i mentioned in almost all of my	77 77 76 77 77 77 77 77
because remember there are 50 other	79 40 67 67 67 67
are released and this happens all the	71 71 71 71 49 49 49
of that make well over 1 million dollars	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
my channel to see more videos just like	71 71 71 70 79 79 79 70
but um atlanta ' s grown a ton in atlanta	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
way if you looked at my acting resume	77 77 77 77 76 76 76 76
not to beat yourself up about it right	41 41 41 41 41 37 37 46

long - term wealth	79 79 79 79
i ' ve done tons of this when i was just	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
and until next time	71 71 68 68
less a bigger market might cost a little	41 41 70 70 49 49 79 79
stunt experience in their background	80 53 50 80 71
I just have more fun when the environment is more aesthetic	58 58 58 67 67 68 68 49 49 79 43
acting facebook groups	80 80 80
Finally in terms of effort to maintain	40 40 49 76 76 76 76
printer paper first do the size	0 0 0 0 0 0
hassle of trimming the resume and then	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
already then let me be the first to tell	41 41 41 41 68 68 67 67 70
the top two he didn ' t get the part	76 76 79 80 80 80 80 80 80 53
it can provide extremely valuable	79 79 79 79 79
good to be prepared because without the	31 31 40 67 67 40 40
families that wanted to to make an offer	43 79 79 79 79 79 43 43
and finally your training have you been	49 41 44 71 52 52 52
no bad about that but it ' s just	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
ethnicity and a short description of the	67 67 49 49 49 49 49
topic which	79 79
on Skill Share who are very kindly	79 79 79 79 79 71 79
america the three most commonly used	49 80 80 79 67 40
about money and stuff should be called	79 70 70 70 70 52 52
old you can start working on your credit	40 40 40 40 40 44 44 44
or teaching someone to do something but	52 79 79 79 79 79 79
that would have been a really poor	77 68 69 68 68 68 71
option is la the best place to go well	77 80 41 41 41 41 41 50 50
but if you invest in the top 500 companies in the U	70 49 49 79 70 79 79 70 49 49 49 49
what camera you are using you should	22 49 49 49 49 50 51
to get started acting in your city right	68 68 71 71 71 70 70 79
less than 20 % is the VA loan and the VA	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 40 70 70
necessarily need to be caucasian so they	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the technical details right	70 68 41 49
your real estate agent ' s time and yeah	49 49 40 40 40 40 40 37 37
to grow your acting career because i	50 50 50 50 71 71 68
literally standing where the main	40 37 64 49 49
and you can just go through the lecture on your own time	79 71 41 41 41 68 68 71 71 71 71 71
first of all you don ' t pay them any	41 41 41 50 50 50 50 50 50 49
Like they actively put a bit of effort	67 67 70 71 67 67 67 67
those of you who have mentioned	71 71 71 71 71 71
thought that these things were things	70 52 79 79 79 79
because we want to see some of your	76 49 77 49 76 49 49 50
the same	67 40
gonna give you more light a better	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
just before they hit a billion in revenue	76 70 77 77 68 77 77 71
lifestyle and get into that whole	40 49 49 22 49 49
So we ' re gonna give that four stars	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
home to cleveland	80 80 71
But secondly realize that that any friendship	41 81 80 80 80 81 81
something new to learn an always room	70 70 71 71 71 79 71
line and simply being aware of the food	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
auditions because the truth is we have	49 49 49 67 68 77 80
number that just says how much gravity	32 40 40 40 40 40 40
are ones that work more in alignment	33 33 33 33 33 33 33
could be but it would need to be more	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
back of your headshot now one more thing	49 41 41 41 40 40 40 40
the three thousand dollar initiation fee	80 71 71 71 68 68
you actually double your money which is pretty awesome	67 67 70 49 49 49 49 40 70
reason why I don ' t like that is because	41 41 41 41 41 41 44 40 76 76
and outs of how to do affiliate	0 0 1 1 0 0 0
you ' re 18 because you ' re gonna be just thinking	76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79 76 76 80 72
you can create your own credit to put on	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
of e - commerce purchases	41 41 41 41 41
minutes a day can be really beneficial	49 49 49 49 49 49 50
for it when we ' re first getting started	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And the idea is that in life	44 41 44 44 49 49 19
you today is to do an activity while	70 49 70 40 79 79 40 70
a chance to see the movie before i did	72 72 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
listen i really wish that i could tell	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
brand was truly such a great investment	77 77 80 76 79 79 79
lot of places have their the calories up	12 14 14 14 50 49 49 49
learn about the process of making a	50 41 71 71 71 50 50
say you live in kansas city you would go	41 41 41 71 0 0 0 0 0
in my first year a big part of those were actually because	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 62 61 61 61
single i and don ' t forget to check out	76 76 76 76 76 76 79 50 53 80
that being said how good your audition	49 71 71 41 70 71 71
is that it is a film competition that	71 71 53 52 49 49 49 49
You know sleeping eight hours a day	79 79 76 76 76 76 79
Well again one out of five stars	49 50 50 50 49 49 50
have to and so those were just three	79 79 70 70 70 70 79 79
really get that knowledge	22 40 40 31
writes every teacher and every coach	41 0 0 0 0 0
with their own mental health problems that you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
plays or doesn ' t have anything that you	50 41 41 41 41 41 40 50 41
30 out of all of those	80 76 77 76 77 77
video then do me a favor and give it a	71 79 79 79 79 77 42 78 42 50
And yes according to the evidence	79 79 79 79 79 79
with this investing thing	70 49 49 79
what ' s the difference between the two	49 49 49 41 71 71 71 40
it ' s possible that the repair costs are	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71
a much more viable long - term solution is	52 52 52 52 25 25 25 52 52
I think it was 17th April	41 41 41 41 41 41
that if you ' re trying to get an agent	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50

And you might fall into the trap	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
afraid that they they ' re gonna let	49 49 49 41 41 41 41 50
In reality it ' s a lot harder to make good videos	70 70 70 70 70 79 70 70 61 61 61 70
whether i was in the show or not it is	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

while it may seem vague and meaningless	79 79 79 52 52 71 71
residuals on those projects let me tell	70 70 70 70 44 49 41
the question that you came here for when	71 71 71 71 71 71 49 49
saying hey we appreciate your service	70 70 71 71 71 70

list is	71 41
actors in your area and just to start a	70 71 71 71 71 79 79 79 71
that is so it ' s important that we rename	67 67 67 76 76 76 76 77 77 68
we ' ve all done if I book this role then	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
a two out of five stars ' cause it ' s not that hard	58 58 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

because you never have to worry about	41 41 41 41 40 40 40
which is what I would do	40 67 70 50 50 50
of which stocks to invest in	49 43 67 67 67 70
was in a position where i was still	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

website whether it ' s on	49 49 40 40 40 40
experience whatsoever	76 71
specifically what exactly are agents	80 80 80 80 80
and i will try to answer as many of your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you are pursuing	37 37 40
prior to getting an agent in fact those	70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71
it would be completely stupid of you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that would be quite a lot of tax	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 54
because it allows them to customize it a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the even thing about that that means	80 80 80 80 79 77 76
podcasts you know my friend Noah Kagan	1 1 21 21 21 21 21
brilliant or forward slash alley and the	26 53 53 53 71 71 80
and told us to follow him inside into	64 64 67 67 67 76 40 41
that commission	53 80
forward and talk to the little girl like	71 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
they reveal it	41 68 41
out those are	70 70 70
this 50 , 000 that I ' ve tried to take out of the business	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
There ' s another metaphor I like which is that	71 71 71 70 68 68 41 49 76 49
up at the same time	31 40 49 49 49
is to work on a team make sure you have	71 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
anyone can do it and that also means	67 40 40 67 40 40 40 40
person is in their sweet spot and they	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that important	41 71
first up is knowing your financing	40 13 31 31 40 31
can be an invaluable experience that	77 76 79 79 77 76
exam once your application goes through	40 76 40 40 40 40
do choose a laminate luxury vinyl	79 79 79 79 79 79
like it was fairly early on	68 67 67 67 70 67
everything you do for experience has to	49 50 50 50 50 49 49
them a load of stuff for free and then	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 52 52
meals in bulk to save money so i always	79 79 79 79 80 71 40 79 79
because it ' s like five hours worth of content	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
keep in mind because anybody that asks	76 76 52 43 43 79 76
if I hadn ' t been as prepared as I was it	68 41 41 41 41 71 41 41 41 41 41 41
the purpose of this video is strictly	49 40 40 49 79 49 50

Unfortunately the CPM doesn ' t actually go to the creator	80 23 50 51 51 51 50 51 68 67 58
term is off - book off - book simply refers	70 70 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
example you have agents like ryan	79 79 79 79 41 41
available to actors you just have to	49 71 71 68 68 68 68
that situation is	71 71 68

Or let ' s say I ' m on my desk and making a video	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 79 79 52 52 52 52 52
but they are not the final decision	67 70 70 70 70 70 70
about where else you should be seeking	71 50 50 40 41 68 71

project that we talked about	41 41 41 41 41
for the next 10 years	70 70 79 80 52
that everybody needs to take into	71 71 41 49 49 49

is to submit a professional headshot	49 49 49 49 52 71
and uh i should have seen this question	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
money from it now even if your main	71 71 41 41 41 41 50 79
guarantee that you ' ll become successful	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
what could feel better than that right	79 79 79 71 71 71 67
digital is it ' s better but there	49 49 22 22 22 49 49 46
for that one part it is very common for	77 77 77 79 76 76 79 79 76
really hard to throw things away	49 49 40 71 71 71
perform a scene they can give you	67 67 67 64 67 67 67

people my age who are looking out of	49 52 40 31 31 31 31 31
is to imagine your surroundings before you begin your audition	41 49 0 0 0 0 41 71 71 41
business especially especially when it	79 79 79 79 79
a handful of auditions a month to maybe	71 71 71 71 71 80 50 50
Overall this one thing leads to another leads to another	67 67 64 64 64 67 67 67 67 76

I knew absolutely nothing about it before then	76 49 71 71 71 71 71 80
don ' t build an audience by selling them	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 77 80
information so just be prepared for that	70 70 79 79 79 79 70

brushes are made out of the point is is	40 40 43 43 43 43 49 49 41
um and you could probably err on the	79 79 52 79 79 79 79 79
i think in that respect background work	71 71 71 71 71 80 50
making it in this industry so i ' ve said	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hometown of Cleveland have opportunities	71 71 71 70 70
which I ' ve been investing in since 2015	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And because the system is quite nice in the UK	79 79 52 79 79 79 79 79 58 58
then even if you don ' t have an audience	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
it ' s because it extends much further	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41
right so you make your mistakes and act	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of stock market indices on Vanguard	22 70 70 52 52 70
it ' s very possible that if i started at	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
building up that downpayment as long as	70 71 71 70 40 40 40
to have to move to one of those markets	80 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 68

because I had the mindset of this is supposed to be hard	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 80 80 71 71 71
than our own	41 71 71
should go without saying but I ' ve heard	49 49 49 49 49 76 76 76 79
what to put on it now before we get	71 71 71 71 71 68 68 68 68
net worth	31 31

your career	70 40
important because it ' s gonna make your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
proper benefits just like	80 80 49 79
because it was in the middle of the	79 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
student films and short films and	41 50 50 41 41 50
well as the big lesson that i learned	67 70 70 71 71 71 71 71

you can make money online by drop	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
financial struggles that they would	76 79 80 80 80
let ' s fast forward to	40 40 40 40 37 40
Therefore number five is what are shares	80 80 71 40 70 70 70
And so in our side hustle assessment matrix	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
capacity that ' s four dollars a month or	41 41 41 41 41 50 49 49 49
from these possessions and so with this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then finally we ' ll talk about the	40 40 70 40 40 40 67 67 67
information about the whole process all	79 79 79 79 79 79
if you ' re interested in learning about	50 50 50 50 77 77 77 68
not you can get	70 70 70 70
just asking questions and then me	49 76 64 67 50 41
want to hire actors for their print ads	68 71 71 71 40 40 70 70
your second mark the next term is I	71 71 71 70 70 61 61 61
and with the PDFs and papers and stuff	79 70 67 70 49 79 79 67
So pretty easy to get started with affiliate marketing	62 79 62 62 63 62 62 62 62
the quote unquote wrong choices but	33 33 33 33 33 33
And so that ' s partly why these audience retention graphs	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 58 67 64 67
as a self - employed person myself i	40 40 40 40 40 41 40 40
i played a doctor which i tend to a lot	79 79 79 80 79 79 79 79 79 79
pay off later the alternative to finding	79 79 79 79 70 61 61
about that in the description below okay	13 40 40 40 40 40 40
contractors that i work with so you know	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
things that you should definitely avoid	71 71 68 68 76 79
do is just understand how	79 79 79 79 79
of the project so when a person buys a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
easier if you have a smaller file size	49 49 79 79 79 79 71 41
first up on my list is brand name	25 43 43 70 70 71 80 80
Sadly these hypothetical 10 % saving accounts	61 61 76 79 79 79 79
working on a television show	79 79 79 79 79
the other actors in the scene having	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
got a speeding ticket or your dog needs	71 67 67 71 71 80 79 79
Now I first came across this in a Jim Collins interview	73 76 79 79 79 79 79 50 41 41 40

actor and in order to be a professional	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
and i ' ll say this too let me just use	41 41 41 41 41 68 53 53 50 50 50
how it ' s happened to me	67 67 67 67 67 67 67
i am still working through this book i	79 79 80 80 79 79 79 79
and i ' ll go to that city and i ' ll work	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76 76 76 76 76

someone asked you that dreaded tell me	68 68 68 68 49 49 49
I probably start to contract these jobs	80 79 79 79 79 79 79
experience and you don ' t have to wait	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
eat and you can stick to that awesome	50 50 50 50 41 41 41 41
before I went to bed and then as soon as	70 70 70 43 40 40 40 70 40 40
So we ' ve talked about the different factors	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50
and if you sign me you won ' t regret it	80 50 50 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
So when you have a business	31 31 31 31 58 31
the drama classes that are available	71 71 71 76 76 79
isn ' t high enough to actually get	41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40
thought you were supposed to be on my	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
we put this home on the market	80 79 79 79 79 79 79
And this question of what game am I really playing	52 52 52 43 43 62 63 63 52 53
and broker education requirements	79 79 79 79
for yourself right this means that you	40 67 40 40 40 40 40
that you may have to incur	67 67 67 67 67 67
purchases of anything including	80 80 80 50
and I definitely want to change that	79 70 79 79 79 79 79
much you spend in your personal life	80 52 80 80 80 80 80
like but i did purchase a website	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

about personal finance investing in	50 50 41 50 41
a multi - million dollar movie set and	73 73 73 73 76 76 76 76
i hope this clears things up a little	43 44 43 77 68 68 68 68
keep doing that but until you have that	33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
rule Teresa 1 type an 8 and then 10 so	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
this i make a ton of content about	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50

talk about first the things that we need	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because you were just taking the time to	80 50 50 50 80 80 71 80

because it ' s not as simple as going on apple	79 52 52 52 79 52 79 52 52 50 71
pretty much only pursuing the film and	50 50 50 50 50 50 51

ago I published a video titled	79 79 41 41 41 71
don ' t photoshop the heck out of them to	50 50 50 79 79 80 80 76 76 76
and behind and behind	72 77 68 67
clients said to me so Kurt tell me about	41 71 71 71 71 71 49 41 71
waking up early and	40 70 70 67
champion and triathlon and duathlon in a	41 41 40 40 40 41 41
like the nine that I ' ve got	61 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
we need to do is to load the printer	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
right and debating back on that you know	41 32 41 41 32 32 29 47
because when they did come in and the	79 79 79 79 79 79 49 76
you also get residual payments for	71 71 71 71 71 40
and the other half are union states	50 50 50 80 80 80 43
this career that I think are hard and	49 52 52 49 49 41 41 41
And if you have more than 20 , 000 pounds to invest in a year	49 49 37 37 37 67 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 40
before getting a talent agent in fact	40 67 67 70 70 70 70
that you have to skip	10 19 19 19 49
you see in new york and the shows that	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40 41
if we ' re doing everything right for	79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70
real agent	41 41
i got over a hundred auditions for	76 79 79 76 79 79 80
for it i ' m going to tell you a story	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
100 focused on building my career	49 70 49 40 49 41
not gonna make you watch me write write	49 49 79 76 49 49 49 49
such that every single company goes down to zero	49 70 41 41 41 70 70 41 38
lines that were already in the script	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
step number one is to start training now	68 77 1 1 1 1 0 0
people that have done this successfully	79 79 79 79 79 79
than x then that is a good	40 67 67 40 40 40 40
standing out of frame off camera who is	73 76 76 73 76 76 76 76
getting started	40 41
and then on the third day i found out	68 41 37 67 67 40 49 49 49

And my middle is amazing	68 68 69 69 68
image on to crop alikom let it load and	0 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 42
that means go stand on your beginning	76 76 76 76 76 76 77
and then right hook but obviously you	41 49 49 49 49 49 49
and then add some more knowledge	79 79 79 79 70 70
the stuff it ' s like having a pair of	79 79 49 49 49 70 70 61 34 61
shoot window and let ' s say you are a	53 49 49 76 76 76 76 76 68 68
in high school	49 70 71
all right now that the agent has the	40 40 41 71 71 71 71 71
know get adding people to your email	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
audition opportunities or	80 80 40
but it ' s really not going to help you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that ' s the first step figuring out as a	49 49 49 49 79 79 79 79 79 79
produced by	77 77
most likely only getting a chance	67 70 40 40 70 70

sure to subscribe to this channel to get	47 47 50 50 41 41 41 41
they uh sit back and relax and they	11 11 11 11 11 19 19 19
they ' re going to expect you to have some	40 40 40 40 40 70 43 31 40 40
differently but they can still have	41 41 41 41 41 41
and then start browsing the public	79 79 79 76 79 79
that is relocation costs when you move	41 71 79 40 40 40 67
but you ' re gonna do the stupid thing	71 62 62 62 71 71 71 70 70
yet how do those actors make money in	67 41 41 53 41 71 71 71
somewhere between october 30th when i	40 40 40 40 40 43
- Even though he ' s absolutely huge	40 40 50 50 50 50 50 50
isn ' t exactly Los Angeles when it comes	79 79 79 79 79 71 71 70 71
or can you start your career from	79 79 49 70 70 70 49
lot cheaper and don ' t even think about	79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76 71
what do most actors do they maintain eye contact	79 79 71 71 71 80 80 71 71
example from my personal experience	41 41 41 71 50
practicing the words anymore you ' re also	44 68 44 43 67 67 67 67
will give you a different answer to this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
was you know a lot easier to get through	79 79 79 52 79 79 79 79 79
actors access or backstage or casting	70 71 71 71 71 71
probably get	31 32
as a few weeks but what i recommend	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
imagine the person that you ' re talking	20 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
and you ' ll have no problem on the test	70 79 79 79 79 79 79 49 49 49
and you put it on Skillshare	63 63 63 63 63 63
unshakable it comes from something that	79 79 79 79 79 79
concepts are gonna work for a wide range	73 73 73 77 77 76 76 81
say that the things that we value our	52 52 52 52 79 79 79 52
where you have	67 67 64
i haven ' t seen it yet but some of my	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
have the name of the	0 0 0 0 0
maintenance like going out and just kind	49 49 49 49 50 49 50
it ' s so much harder in my opinion to	40 40 40 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
This is not bad at all specially considering	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
she ' s making somewhere between 2 , 000 and 5 , 000 pounds	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
attention directly by doing sponsorships	0 0 0 0 20
and business project and many more will	79 41 41 41 41 41 40
any way then you can absolutely write	31 31 1 31 31 31 31
management for actors	67 67 50
with the director ' s vision and that	33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
when you do in solid lights make sure to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
I ' ll talk about that in a different video	40 40 40 40 40 40 61 79 79 71
actors union we ' ll go over questions	73 76 71 71 71 41 41 80
so please do as much research as you can	41 41 41 41 41 71 41 41 41
how do we find the things that are meaningful to us	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
and in my entire 13 - year career i have	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41

a similar commercial	79 79 79
fico score is made up of payment history	40 67 67 71 40 40 41 70
because that pays for a takeaway every single day	33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
and I ' m sure his stance on this is actually more nuanced	49 76 76 76 76 76 67 64 67 70 70 67 67
available now for example	79 79 70 79

to this channel to get more videos on	69 69 69 41 71 71 71 71
every time that commercial plays meaning	79 79 76 79 79 79
auditions whether that ' s a casting	71 79 70 70 70 71 71
these are examples of industrial videos	40 67 49 71 70 49

whether you get cut or not	79 79 79 79 79 79
your drink for you	79 61 70 70
look i asked my agent this question	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
if they ask for it you should be able to	76 76 76 73 76 77 77 50 41 41
in that the more videos a YouTuber creates	76 49 49 49 79 79 79 79

I keep preaching about it but it really	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
were very resilient people and our body	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and I ' d be like oh that idea for a video	64 64 64 64 64 41 41 37 37 37 37 37
understanding that we ' re not starting	49 76 73 73 73 73 73
on that so fifteen thousand dollars	40 31 40 31 67 67
websites out there so Redfin Zillow	79 79 79 79 79 79
watching your audition whether that	79 79 79 76 79
traditional you ' re paying taxes later on	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
all the content by the way if you guys	49 40 41 13 13 13 22 22 22
Secondly we have a quote from Kurt Vonnegut	67 70 70 70 70 79 52 79
actor all right so way number one is	71 50 50 37 40 41 41 41
drive - through and grab the wrap of mocha	41 41 41 41 50 50 50 50 41
investors will pool their money	79 49 79 79 49
about the patient ' s part of it right and	22 22 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50
information and have it stick in your	70 71 71 71 79 79 79
okay what am I gonna do to fill that	22 49 49 49 46 46 49 41 41
allowed me to grow so much is my team of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
when you look at the science of it you	32 41 41 41 41 41 32 32 32
3 % over asking price so I just wanted to	79 79 79 53 52 79 79 80 79 53
and especially if you ' re brand new	80 80 50 50 50 50 80 80
cost a little bit more	71 71 71 71 71
or digital goods then your ability to	68 68 67 67 67 46 49
people are gonna like it and you won	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you can really see why it ' s so critical	70 79 79 70 70 62 62 62 61 61
one week before your actual exam start	40 40 40 40 31 41 41
online educator what are the things that	76 79 79 52 79 79 79
and money investment that i have made	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
reference the the patient ' s chart and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
going to that link right there alright	34 34 34 34 43 71 52
most major cities have talent agents now	67 70 49 80 80 80 67
what even without knowing your exact	68 68 71 71 71 71
keep practicing keep	71 71 71
that are like short - term painful for long - term gain	52 53 53 53 53 53 53 0 0 0 0 0
auditions and	79 79
and save on the right things as well we	70 79 80 80 79 79 79 80 80
actor who wants to break into the film	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
number three is to make sure your video	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
That means I have to pay 13 , 162 pounds	79 81 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
recommend you take a voiceover class if	71 71 71 71 71 71 41
stop worrying about your looks and start focusing	71 79 79 79 68 68 68 68
much money to do so okay second on my	40 49 49 49 49 41 23 41 41
a good actor	41 71 31
if I buy the Tesla Model 3 for 50	31 31 61 61 58 31 58 58 58
that life energy is generally worth it	40 40 37 67 70 70 52
and go to that event that maybe you ' ve been putting off	80 80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
being said	49 49
there was one take that I remember where	76 76 76 76 76 76 73 76
And so now I ' m going from making absolutely nothing per day	41 40 40 40 40 40 50 49 40 49 40 40 40
film and in the scene is a husband and a	70 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 70
filmmaking so for example let ' s say you	40 49 49 76 67 67 67 67 67
state currently	52 52
another way that actors can make money	80 79 52 41 41 71 71
acting world	79 79
one year you drive 10	49 49 49 49 31
see success a lot quicker the next thing	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
was i lived way too far away	49 49 49 49 76 76 76
The second approach is actually instead of	50 77 79 19 50 50 49
this is split between three separate	58 58 58 64 55 58
information as i can	79 79 71 68
I ' ve learned since about why that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
So adding an extra 2000 pounds	0 0 0 0 0 0
you want to spend	71 71 71 41
about fifteen percent	31 31 40
is in commercials a lot of actors make a	49 49 79 70 52 79 79 71 76
we then move beyond niceties to luxuries	1 1 1 0 0 0 0
other people to cast us in a project	50 50 50 41 41 41 41 41
475 000 and putting 25k	11 11 11 11 19
that sort of money	58 58 58 58
actors to learn those concepts through	67 67 67 67 40 13
costume for an audition and I first	79 79 79 79 79 77 77
out there a ton of real estate agents	40 40 49 49 49 49 49 49
not then	79 40
by just filming with your phone and uploading it	70 52 43 70 70 70 70 52 52
important thing to understand	0 0 0 0
adding a couple lines uh they added a	79 79 71 80 80 79 79 79
that lived	76 49
without a having a large amount of money to start with	61 61 71 71 81 41 71 61 61 61 61
they make acting look so easy and	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
ellie sattler hey if you ' re getting	0 77 77 77 77 77 77 77
But you wanna start doing things at 18	79 79 71 71 71 77 77 77
a city nearby	49 49 41
method to avoid	41 41 79
you look at it over a whole year that	70 67 76 79 79 79 79 70 70
and then just cancel out the other	40 40 70 79 70 79 79
reason why i say up to three thousand	67 67 67 71 71 71 71 71
background work or being an extra now	71 71 40 40 70 70 70
it just isn ' t and and i understand if	71 71 71 71 71 49 49 49 50 50
on my list	79 79 79
hard feelings and this at the very end	50 50 50 49 49 49 49 50
gonna range from twenty seven hundred K	79 79 79 52 51 51 51
in here to achieve financial	40 49 49 79 79

right before my last breath and then I	79 79 79 79 79 49 49 79
audition videos should be horizontal	73 73 73 73 73
there is a potential that you could get	67 67 70 67 70 67 67 76
an amateur and again	80 80 77 77
which takes it down to 40	79 79 79 81 81 81
tell me about your dog well guess what	71 71 70 70 71 71 71 68

you rely on your income so much um i	79 80 80 80 71 71 70 79 70
I ' m gonna be making from this video	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

real estate investing whether that	41 41 40 49 49

mistakes because you ' ve made them before	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And so that means that every year stuff costs about 2 % more	52 52 52 52 52 70 52 80 79 79 70 70 67
experience than me	43 40 37
lot of us really struggle with this	80 81 80 80 80 80 80
for people that do voice acting but	68 71 41 41 68 49 50

the curtain of how this whole casting	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
learning every time i ' m on set right so	40 40 49 41 41 41 71 71 41 50
will regret making the decision to invest	76 70 79 79 79 52 52
your friends as you were having chills in your room	76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

you haven ' t already subscribe to this	67 50 50 50 77 41 68 71
the age is 40s or 50s and you ' re only in	52 52 25 25 25 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and she looks at the difference	40 40 49 41 41 40
viola davis and oscar isaac	71 71 71 71 71
the best case scenario is when you have	44 53 53 53 44 44 41 43
think about when you ' re considering	50 50 50 80 80 80 80
studying with music working with music	70 79 79 79 80 80
someone lived in another country and	67 67 67 67 67 67
your investment will be worth it in the	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
important to the beginning of every	40 70 67 67 67 71

And so in terms of maintenance of the podcast	70 70 52 52 52 52 52 70 43
video where i talked about black widow i	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
to equal the average view count for each video	49 49 49 49 79 77 77 76 76
on your down payment there are a ton of	31 31 31 31 31 40 40 70 40
really lets you get into a home with not	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
screenshot from the actual show	71 61 61 62 58
off of	79 79
the fun part begins when you start	40 40 40 40 49 22 13
And actually the best way to learn Python	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah but until then you know you gotta	46 46 49 49 49 49 49 49
and most of that time was spent just	70 70 70 70 70 70 43 70
actor who they wanted for the sheriff	73 73 73 73 73 64 64
actors and it was distributed by 20th	41 50 50 49 52 49 49
So now I ' ve got a whole list of projects that I ' m working	70 70 70 70 70 40 50 51 51 50 52 52 49 49 49 73
so that you understand exactly how	79 80 54 81 80 80
that and I think a lot of	49 49 38 41 50 50 49
and in those instances they will post	68 68 68 49 49 49 49
photography business and growing a	79 79 79 79 70
audition for donna belijak in her office	71 67 68 71 71 71 71
you ' ve possibly wondered at some point	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
generally speaking to invest in individual stocks	0 0 0 0 0 76 70
told a story as actors we are	67 67 67 67 41 40 41
know that you	79 52 79
Because for example if we look at Apple stock price	71 71 71 71 70 70 70 70 52 79
and the southeast so in this market	70 40 79 79 79 52 46
secondly people in the internet I got	49 76 79 79 10 10 10
Naked cakes with history of dying friend	41 71 71 71 71 71 49
agent and you have some commercial	0 0 0 0 0 0
you would use again the same three	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you ' ll probably move on to bigger and	61 61 61 79 79 79 79 79 79
october 9th and then i self - taped my	68 49 76 76 49 76 76 76 67
blockbuster movies and they ' re not major	49 71 41 50 50 50 50 50
through a commission	50 50 50
so let ' s say you were in a couple shows	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i ' m really good at it and what am i	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 41 49
in my emails or on my blog and things	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
there is absolutely no excuse to turn an	19 49 79 79 79 76 76 79
That means this is a roundabout of $ 15 , 000 per week	70 52 22 22 49 52 50 49 49 49 49 49 49
easier to clean you need	70 70 70 40 40
audition is what ' s happening in your	74 77 77 77 77 77 74 74
So that was kind of where the idea came from	52 67 76 49 49 52 49 49 67 76
you need 28 students to take that class every month	49 50 50 50 49 50 50 50 41 50
the sooner you start investing	52 52 79 79 79
homes for them to see so yeah right when	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 43 43
or the top 100 companies in the UK	70 79 79 52 52 79 79 52
And so I think the problem	67 67 67 67 76 76
agency ask your teacher or other	71 70 70 70 80 80
you have control over that and that can	40 41 70 71 71 68 68 68
earn over three times as much revenue	40 40 40 40 41 41 41
something with your phone film a scene	49 49 49 49 76 79 79
over a very long period of time	76 79 79 79 40 71 79
you ' ll know how to run numbers that tell	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
money and time on your self	31 31 1 28 31 31
You absolutely can	1 11 0
enough money to put down 20 % it ' s either	79 76 67 67 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
brother so I have to know like it	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
multiple marks on the ground they might	77 77 76 76 76 76 79
sheet that you can get from the acting	70 68 70 70 71 71 71 70
attractiveness does come into play as	41 41 71 71 71 71
making a living activity with more life	0 11 11 11 80 80 81
this journey certainly won ' t be easy in	41 41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
people in the mastermind i was learning	79 79 70 70 49 49 49
auditions from home well let me share	71 71 71 71 71 79 79
renovate it and then live in it for at	79 79 79 71 71 79 71 40 49
if they should go to college and major	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
have a beginning mark and an end mark	79 79 80 72 72 81 77 49
cities they ' re doing this because they	50 80 80 80 53 53 80 80
do plumbing we say	79 79 79 79
if you ' re willing to do all of that for	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50 50 41
making it at home you actually have to	70 70 70 70 79 79 79 79
like you may not fit the description of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
post those auditions publicly why do	71 71 71 71 80 80
and everything because I just wanted a	50 50 50 19 19 19 19
places right so oh I ' m sorry no go ahead	41 40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
preference I ' ve never heard of casting	47 50 50 50 77 50 79 79
particular role because	67 67 49
self taping has become an absolutely	0 80 71 41 80 41
mention is that some of the some of	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
There is no YouTube AdSense for podcasts	40 40 40 40 40 40 41
you learn the skills you need to break	68 68 68 68 72 72 72 72
You won ' t see any problems when you ' re 18	79 79 79 79 49 49 49 20 19 19 19 19
is roundabout $ 3 , 000 a week	58 58 59 59 59 59 59 68
And so when I ' d be studying	41 41 41 41 41 41 40 37
who wants that look at the features the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and that ' s gonna waste a lot of money so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
insurance per year right now in order to	71 70 70 71 71 70 70 61
Vampire Diaries during its final season	71 71 71 76 79 79
both in your business and in your	49 70 70 79 49 53 80
extremely good money back guarantee so	49 40 0 0 0 0
give an audition to that actor because	50 50 50 50 50 53 53
record a self tape as a demo reel do it	49 49 49 50 50 50 49 40 40 40
they were kind of joking and laughing	26 26 26 26 26 26 53
to gain experience you ' re going to get a	80 71 71 53 53 53 41 41 68 68
we also want to make sure they can see	49 49 49 49 49 19 19 19 19
there ' s nothing wrong with playing that game	52 52 52 52 52 52 44 43 53
When you have that thought process	71 79 79 43 62 44
classes or	70 71
well here ' s what happened after the	41 41 41 41 41 41 71 44
just buying a property and leasing it	31 31 31 32 32 40 40
we ' re working on and getting feedback	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
promise you ' ll start on your path to you	31 31 31 31 10 20 11 21 21 0
rent it out to people all that kind of stuff	49 49 52 49 52 79 79 79 79 40
something that I ' ve worked on to try to	41 41 41 41 41 41 47 41 41 41
estate career is to get a mentor	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
or a detective who ' s sitting across the	67 67 67 67 67 67 40 40 40
you ' re saying the words back and forth	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 64
homes for yourself then you might not	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
decide song you make sweet the sting	77 80 80 80 80 77 77
property but the trade	79 79 79 79
You ' re gonna join all these clubs	49 49 49 49 46 49 49 76
topics we covered	76 76 76
how extravagant your life is or not	79 80 80 80 79 79 80
challenging and shows you will never be	77 71 68 68 71 71 68
shown then	67 67
as you start to do web series or student	73 64 64 76 67 67 76 76 76
and so from for an actor ' s life you know	50 50 50 46 46 46 46 46 19 46 46
should also have some type of	40 40 40 40 40 40
place outside at night or it ' s a you	71 71 71 71 71 53 53 53 53 71
that ' s going to be super exciting change	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
they look after their diet	67 67 67 67 64
know anything but i want you to	79 79 76 79 79 79 79
experiences as well as the advice of two	77 77 79 79 79 79 76 76
use all seven of these techniques to	40 64 67 67 67 67 67
the other nine that we ' ve talked about	71 62 71 71 71 71 71 41 41
research and start networking this step	70 70 70 71 71 79
something that takes ages to get going	79 67 70 70 67 67 67
I looked like an amateur actor with no clue how to make a conversation	41 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71
accountant and this	80 80 80
How do I actually do that	70 70 70 76 70 70
audition for and work on both non	71 50 41 68 50 50 80
learning and i hope to see you on set	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 0 0
but hopefully this was a reasonably concise	41 41 41 41 41 40 40
should do it because i ' m not really like	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
theater you ' ll have	0 0 0 0 0
by bonnie gillespie	40 40 40
because generally you don ' t need to	50 49 46 49 49 49 49 49
of the way	40 43 43
button and also subscribe to my channel	61 61 61 61 61 61 61
a little recorder like this and not just	67 67 67 52 79 79 79 79
I would rather have a bit more fun by listening to music	49 52 79 76 49 44 41 79 70 41 49 49
a huge fan of shaq when he was playing	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
But you know if I think about what I want from my life	49 76 67 68 49 49 49 49 46 67 76 76 77
next booking just because you didn	73 76 76 76 76 73
will get 20 % of the annual premium	44 53 53 53 80 49 41 41
where the median kind of average salary	58 58 55 55 55 58 58
that that class setting that want the	38 49 49 37 49 49 49
gonna do that instead what i want you	40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49
and yeah sometimes you ' ll be auditioning	50 49 49 40 40 40 40 43
weeks later they called my agent and	79 76 79 79 79 79 76
are pretty low which makes it one of the	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
in terms of price	79 43 64 64
think I mean that ' s really all I wanted	46 46 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
valuable it was presented and they	0 0 0 0 0 52
before and I thought for some reason she	76 79 70 67 41 40 67 71
insurance is basically a policy that	71 19 0 0 0 0
or on Twitter or on social media or whatever	0 0 0 0 41 49 49 41 41
so that ' s why i think monologues are a	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
There were two of them themed around productivity	77 77 79 79 79 79 79 79
don ' t know what we ' re doing it ' s gonna	70 70 70 71 71 71 71 71 41 41 41 41 49
my actual booking when did i find out	79 71 41 49 49 49 49 49
after television would be film	0 0 0 0 0
you do why else would you be watching	79 79 79 76 71 71 71 71
acting career now i want to take it a	79 52 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
are three levels of making money online	76 76 76 49 49 49 49
And people usually say that your emergency fund should have	70 70 70 79 50 80 44 70 76 44
that much anyway in fact	76 77 71 71 71
mean that we don ' t have to cook	80 71 44 50 50 50 50 41 70
i consider that investing in real estate	40 40 40 32 32 32 32

you could have mid - roll ads	62 62 62 0 0 0 0
quarantine you had already started	50 49 49 49 49

first picture that people see of the	43 43 52 52 52 43 13
have taken classes and you ' ve got	80 80 80 40 70 70 70 70
along the coast are scenes and the	31 40 71 71 43 68 68

have to go that far you could do	67 67 67 76 76 73 76 76
it ' s actually due because you don ' t know	40 40 40 41 49 49 50 49 49 49 49
whatever business you are	79 79 79 79
the commercial world doesn ' t use the	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
booked roles on the same project so this	50 71 68 71 71 67 70 79
huge long career yet but i still feel	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and match the salary you need to make	49 79 80 80 80 80 80 79
here ' s another thing that you should	68 68 68 71 41 40 67 40
you can also open an investment account	41 41 40 31 1 1 31

to take a class learn your craft I can	70 70 71 71 71 71 70 70 41
save or invest that money so with that	40 40 40 40 41 41 41 40
and have a vision have a goal	52 49 49 40 10 10 10
but the only way I would ' ve done that is	71 71 71 71 68 67 67 67 70 70 70
all know that an actor ' s headshot is	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49

stress situation like a big budget	79 79 79 79 79 79
auditioning and career advice every	71 71 71 71 71
the business you can be doing plays to	71 71 71 71 80 79 79 79
to make sure the name of the file has	77 80 80 77 68 68 68 68 77
percent of the home that you actually	49 49 49 49 53 53 53
your body needs to be in a position	19 19 19 46 19 49 49 40
when i was signing up for internet	70 43 70 70 70 71 71
it ' s like well how the hell	49 49 49 19 19 19 41 41
earning it spending it investing it	70 70 70 70 70 67
than an actively managed fund	70 49 49 79 49
an agent or casting director or producer	41 40 40 40 40 40 40
and this is completely legal the second	40 40 67 43 58 40 40
certainly didn ' t hurt the next lesson	59 62 62 62 71 71 71 68
you ' re working so hard and you have	80 80 80 80 79 79 80 80 80

protector for the iPad pro using my link	53 44 53 53 26 26 26 53
And finally point number 15 is the power of project lists	70 70 40 49 49 49 76 70 79 52 79
for a television show the final decision	79 79 79 40 40 67 67
of the population is gonna know which	41 41 41 41 49 41 41
for an acting resume is that background	0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the value of the home	31 31 31 31 58
doesn ' t seem like much when you ' re at	40 40 40 79 79 79 71 43 43 43 79
and let ' s assume you ' re not getting any traffic	49 49 49 49 41 68 68 68 79 67 41 41

I had a project that I was doing	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 68

haven ' t downloaded my 10 step	41 41 41 71 71 71 71
get together with some other actors and	41 41 41 41 41 49 49
casting networks and backstage if you	70 67 70 70 41 49
auditioning and career advice every	79 76 79 79 80
started it ' s absolutely a sense	71 71 71 71 70 71 71
concept of pay to play where you need to	79 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your work	50 50
get a really good sense on how they	41 10 49 49 49 49 49 49
they offer you that peace of mind what i	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
gonna be closer to the source of the	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
is that we could make a pretty	19 19 19 49 49 49 49
Tip number four is to actually really think	19 19 19 11 71 71 71 43
great program and it ' s great for	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 79
People are nice people are friendly	79 79 79 79 79 79
all right let ' s talk about these four	38 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41
films student films and theater	21 1 71 68 49
getting your first little bit	40 44 41 40 41
having like a specific focus or you know	79 79 49 49 79 52 52 52
is the training from it the the building	49 71 71 70 40 40 40 58
little did I know that my plan would totally backfire	77 77 41 71 41 49 50 71 71 71
spot a phony the rule of thumb here is	71 71 71 79 79 79 79 79 79
supporting roles but let ' s just focus on	41 41 40 40 40 40 67 76 79
if you haven ' t already and leave me a	41 68 41 41 41 67 67 67 64 64
and you wanna join this journey of lifelong learning	40 40 40 37 67 67 67 40 40
casting directors say no absolutely not	70 70 61 33 40 67
and buying a house and you need money for the deposit	70 70 70 70 70 70 40 40 40 71 71
Whereas if you had those stay savings and put them	58 58 58 58 58 58 61 58 58 58
account who can share with you so	53 53 53 63 63 62 43

on an acting resume all right moving on	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
which is why the audience retention graphs	21 19 19 19 67 67 67
because i didn ' t have the mental	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
it ' s because that whole initial appeal	49 49 49 49 49 40 49 49
them a training video of how to do their	49 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 58
The iPad video has made more money	60 59 59 60 60 63 63
There are three caveats though	58 58 58 61 40
investing in self - taping equipment is	68 68 68 68 68 68 68
experience where you	41 41 41
or thousands of dollars per year if you	79 70 70 70 40 34 34 40
minute but the first lesson that I	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
to think about and if you ' re at the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
long ago 50 years ago so the bones are	76 77 76 77 77 79 79 79 79
now and when it ' s done	68 67 68 68 68 68 65
your website down in the comments or in	41 41 41 40 40 40 50 41

is like using a few mindset shifts	40 40 40 67 76 50 50
is to do things with your friends	53 53 68 65 65 65 65
decision for you	71 49 52
you ' re gonna use it again in the next	70 70 70 70 70 52 40 43 40 40
waste so much money buying tons and tons	41 70 61 61 70 61 61 70
this means that you ' re improving the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 61
then you have to go to a professional	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
plenty of scammers out there trying to	79 71 71 71 71 70 70
your bedrooms so if you want to impress	52 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because actors can also make money off	49 70 40 70 71 71 40
any of this stuff is to just enroll in	79 79 70 70 70 70 70 71 70

should turn up some acting studios in	76 79 79 79 79 79 80

some kind of value that someone else is	67 49 49 52 49 22 49 49
And then the crash happens and then by what is it	76 49 79 79 52 52 52 22 22 22 22
to get the most bang for your buck on	79 79 79 80 79 79 79 79 79

But if we look at the watch time	63 63 63 60 60 60 60 60
not your contact information you don	0 0 0 0 0 0
questions when it comes to the stuff	70 70 70 40 31 31 34
professional actor you got to understand	50 50 50 50 50 80
i ' ve actually put together	80 80 80 79 77 71
is the process that i use for all of my	41 41 41 40 40 70 40 40 71 71
college that	71 71
the crowd that ' s how you show them that	71 71 71 71 71 80 80 79 79 79
do to change that	41 41 41 41
you ' re spending hours and hours sitting	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
barking it all the big dogs along the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
basically some type of service that	49 49 40 41 41 41
application and during that time I	40 40 40 13 40 68
that you will probably have to think	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actor in their own country	76 76 76 76 76
and some will have multiple callbacks	70 67 40 40 71 79
one role	79 79
are for sure a scam so run the other way	71 71 71 67 76 76 79 79 79 79
Secondly you should try and develop some skills	79 79 80 70 68 81 72 72
with questions go head and use this and	71 71 71 71 71 49 49 49
then just go with the cheaper one you	43 52 52 79 79 79 49 49
McDonald ' s because those are competing	49 49 49 49 41 41 41
to your two that means go stand over on	44 44 43 52 53 53 71 71 71
here in the united states okay so the	71 71 71 71 71 50 41 41
necessarily true story and generic brand	79 79 70 43 79 79
a small market so when you live in a	80 80 71 50 80 80 80 80 80
performer records it on their own and	50 49 40 70 70 67 64
in acting from a college or a university	71 79 49 79 79 79 79 80
especially especially people	71 71 77
auditions for all kinds of opportunities	41 41 41 41 41 71
mark and then you ' re gonna do all of	40 40 40 49 49 49 50 49 50 50
is that it is not the casting director	67 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
pays lenders and banks for losses due to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
need to track the things that will	52 79 79 79 79 79 79
so those were three ways to show an	76 76 76 80 80 80 76 79
the 30 for 30 I ' m gonna put a link to	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 14
When you were in school then the game was very much	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
beforehand right we worked on our lines	79 79 79 76 79 79 79
to see you can also browse publicly	70 50 80 71 41 71 41
could just be paying a few thousand	79 79 70 71 79 79 79
exam and get your certificate	40 49 49 49 50
of all of the benefits of lifelong adult learning	67 67 67 67 70 70 49 52 52
so that they can be the best that they	71 71 70 76 76 76 76 76 76
or some kind of software product that you can offer	70 70 70 52 79 49 49 40 70 70
of the business	79 79 71
commonly used for actors	67 67 70 70
So sometimes those are ads	0 0 0 0 0
think about how much money you spend	52 43 79 0 0 3 11
made all right that ' s it for today	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
whereas if you move to a market like	70 67 67 40 68 71 68 76
the type of job that ' s where you might	70 70 43 40 41 41 41 41 40 40
To use my example I made 70 videos	80 79 79 52 52 52 52 79
do these extra projects to make yourself a bit	50 80 80 80 79 79 79 79 79
higher monthly payment alright number	79 70 71 71 16
into the overall loan so basically that	0 0 0 0 70 61 61
this happens sometimes because the	67 41 71 71 67
there ' s something wrong on a set or you	50 50 50 50 49 49 49 49 49 49
the united states	71 41 41

ability because	41 40
help me memorize my lines is to record	41 41 71 67 67 40 70 70
We run like three or four events per week	58 58 58 59 59 59 58 58 58

is employment and sadly you cannot buy a	40 70 40 49 49 49 41 40
the next thing that every actor will	50 77 77 77 50 49 50
it really depends on the lender so take	40 53 71 71 71 40 40 40
it ' s basically when you ' re getting a	40 40 40 31 4 4 4 4 31 31
assistant who works for me and just a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
control as actors	71 71 77

hey give me some auditions	50 50 50 50 77
the commercial world a typical example	71 41 49 41 43 67
a year and so ultimately as robin says	0 0 79 49 71 11 11 11
nine union productions can do whatever	41 41 40 79 79 79
downsides now like I briefly mentioned	76 49 49 50 50 49
now before we move on to the last two	40 79 79 52 50 50 50 50 53
career in itself all right man this was	19 19 19 19 19 46 19 49
out and throw a 100 bill away right and	40 40 31 31 49 49 49 49 40
by myself and realize that this is the worst thing ever	64 64 64 70 70 70 70 53 53 80 80
means that we see just how amazing humanity is	49 49 52 79 80 71 54 53 53
get the opportunity to do theater	79 79 79 79 79 79
house without a job i mean it sort of	40 49 50 53 40 40 40 31 31
I ' m very quick at moving from one thing	62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62
take your money by offering you false	70 70 67 67 67 70 71

I might be too young for other parts and	40 50 50 50 81 81 81 80 80
great you can put all of that onto your	49 49 79 71 71 71 68 71 71

for a character like a tv news anchor	43 43 43 40 49 76 49 49
the full three thousand dollars	49 49 52 50 53

cheat sheet if you haven ' t already	71 71 71 71 49 49 49 49
casting director then is less likely to	52 52 52 52 52 52 52
know how to run the numbers so why do we	40 31 31 31 31 31 40 49 49 49
or like 3 , 000 and $ 7 , 000 per month	52 52 52 52 52 43 52 52 52 52 52 52
the very end of May so I think like May	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
remember i told you earlier that that	41 71 41 41 41 40 67
distract	71
the computer like coding and websites	64 67 67 67 67 67

a moo a role in a feature film and i	68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 79 79
so best case scenario let ' s say that	10 10 10 10 19 19 19 10 10
paid off monthly throughout the course	67 70 70 61 61 70
know if you have things you want to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
license and we ' ll talk more about the	67 67 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
working for them if you want to make the	40 67 40 67 40 67 40 40 58
hard and it ' s kind of a more advanced	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
do as much as you can where you are and	41 40 40 70 70 70 70 70 43 70
multi - unit living one of the units and	31 31 31 31 31 28 28 28 31
and sort of gave lots of money for charity	67 67 67 67 46 46 22 49 49
You ' re gonna really enjoy hanging out with people	80 80 80 80 52 52 79 79 79 79
your course then you will apply to take	61 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
But the more you can kind of produce hopefully valuable	70 70 64 64 64 70 70 70 70 67
character was originally written for	79 79 79 79 79
in the description below they always run	67 70 67 70 67 58 70
to the people who have invested in the company	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 40 49
boring boring be enthusiastic and	79 49 49 49 49
income and help you save a lot of money	70 70 67 70 70 70 70 70 70
real estate course this should take	40 40 40 40 49 49
And I first came across this kinda towards the end of 2019	70 70 70 70 71 71 67 67 67 40 40 67
because every time are you thinking	58 31 31 31 31 31
this for this whole page and a half	77 80 50 49 79 76 76 76
it ' s all useful information to have if	40 40 40 70 40 67 67 67 67
spent doing on - camera acting	50 49 79 79 79 80
diagnose what your problems are so	50 68 68 40 40 40
how many	41 41
as a film and television actor you see a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actor by doing these things you can also	80 71 71 71 80 71 71 71
the reason is the phone is a touchscreen	40 40 41 41 41 41 41 41
that ' s gonna get you the best rate and	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67
get better at the process of auditioning	51 51 80 71 71 71 76
two to three to four million dollars now	44 53 53 53 79 71 71 44
but we never actually got to be in the	40 41 50 49 49 41 41 41 41
individual activity that acting is	40 40 41 41 49
as well as they do have really good	61 79 70 61 79 79 79 79
gives you an audition	67 76 76 50
would i have had the same amount of	52 52 79 79 79 79 79 79
going to involve some type of blend	79 79 79 79 79 61 79
afford in atlanta when i was looking at	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
work on	50 67
nobody in this industry cares if you	79 79 79 76 76 76 76
they were very fast and very efficient	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
so that they could stay on schedule so	43 67 70 70 71 71 71 40
only goes through agencies and are not	80 80 80 80 71 71 79
join the union let me just give you an	41 43 43 80 53 50 50 50 41
fifteen thousand dollars more in a year	67 64 64 67 70 70 70
that and jump on that opportunity	79 79 79 79 79 71
so so I think this video what I wanted	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
especially because we have all these	70 70 70 40 40 40
times people are just worried about the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
your eyes should be looking during your	71 71 71 71 41 44 71
step further and talk about how	79 79 79 79 79 79
show and	80 67
because that ' s the thing that I can see in front of me	79 49 49 49 49 43 40 76 79 49 49 49 76 76
was the main character i ' m not 100 sure	40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41 41 40
have a lot of connections number five is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
about this on the internet that people have calculated	70 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 31
imdb profile but you don ' t need to do	79 68 68 67 67 67 67 68 68 71
of what you originally paid for the house	50 50 50 49 79 40 40 70
put down 3 . 5 % for an FHA loan you only	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 79 79 79
honestly the best place that I	49 71 70 52 41 50
thumbnail that i used for this video is	49 49 50 41 41 41 41 41
if i go into an audition and i don	52 53 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
director or talent agent say that they	79 79 79 79 79 79 50
professional headshot an agent may ask	41 41 41 80 40 40
of setting a daily highlight	79 79 79 76 76
This is very much a set it and forget it strategy	70 40 58 61 40 67 67 70 70 49 49
bold letters right at the top it could	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because they can be extremely lucrative	40 40 40 40 40 67
in most things in life these days	52 52 43 52 52 25 25
reader is standing closer to the camera	64 64 67 67 67 67 67
product there ' s a guy called Kevin Kelly	51 71 71 71 49 49 76 76 77
a look around your house	71 70 49 79 79
trying to I ' m not used I don ' t use your	40 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
of training	70 71
huge video files or streaming netflix on	70 70 41 31 61 70 43
I was like " Look you have to be able to put in the effort	41 41 40 40 40 31 59 63 63 63 60 63 63 63 63
you need and take that class it ' s not	71 71 79 79 79 79 71 71 71 71
of the mortgage these loans are issued	71 71 71 61 61 70 70
and yes i get it headshots cost money	80 80 77 77 76 79 79 79
and then you would ask them a question about it	49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 44 44
and so that ' s why i think studying	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of oh i gotta book this acting job	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

now a lot of people want to know how to	71 41 49 49 50 41 41 41 41 41

if you ' re thinking about starting an	79 79 79 79 41 71 71 71

prop like that the action of painting	79 79 79 40 40 40 40
in this video i ' m going over seven	16 40 43 43 43 43 43 43 67

a week after that i was notified that i	77 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

The problem is that like everything else in life	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 54 54
after 30 days of working your second	68 68 68 71 71 80 80

other working actors that you know where	76 76 76 76 76 76 79
where the actor goes into the casting	76 76 73 76 76 76 67

just book the actor off of the initial	76 76 76 77 77 80 80 80
when you can reinvest the money you	40 40 40 40 31 31 31
starting at the age of 26 i actually	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
what you can do is you can write it off	79 79 79 76 79 79 76 79 76 79
or you can just go directly into making	31 31 40 40 31 31 31 31

The more time you leave your money in the stock market	79 79 71 70 70 79 79 79 79 79 52
at inopportune times	73 73 40
are willing to pay to target a certain type of video	62 71 71 71 53 53 0 0 0 0 0
see a commercial for a product or a	58 61 61 70 70 70 67 70
job is to help tell a story to the	40 41 41 41 50 50 42 42 41
share with you the story	49 41 41 41 71
You ' re gonna make a website	63 63 63 63 71 71 71
listening and responding	41 71 71
important part of the audition is still	50 50 50 50 50 50 50
here ' s how it works you ' re basically	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
So going back to our side hustle assessment matrix	26 26 53 53 53 53 53 53 53
you would actually made a lot of money	52 52 51 51 51 50 49 49
I remember a few years ago	79 79 79 79 79 76
for it	0 0
something like that whereas with this	50 52 52 76 76 49
eyes got to pick on my dogs Boop I	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40
have a huge audience	71 70 70 70
the library and just finding these books	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
paid for it what can be better	71 76 49 49 76 76 76
talking about first avoid anything	71 71 71 71 41
the major cities in the united states	79 79 68 71 71 71 77
works is that	41 41 41
and internalize it within ourselves	79 52 79 49 49
agent because the only time you pay your	53 43 43 50 50 50 50 50
go to find these auditions especially if	70 70 70 70 70 79 79
and maybe that ' s what you need	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 77
every single audition is memorable then	71 71 41 68 71 71
during your audition they are basically	40 43 52 52 49 49
And tip number five is kind of if we ' re thinking ahead	52 52 44 49 49 49 23 53 53 53 53 53 53
it shows right there	42 42 51 50
playing the game that you thought you were playing	79 79 76 76 76 76 77 50 81
leads like i mentioned earlier there	79 79 79 79 79 52
there is so much stuff to be done in	79 79 79 74 74 74 74 74 74
But then when I turned on monetization	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then also keep an eye out for when they	76 76 80 79 79 79 79 79 79
car insurance now buying car insurance	79 71 71 61 62 61
or go to somebody that has the tools	41 41 42 42 41 41 41 41

Oh died uh I like um I like I like	71 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41
pros and the cons of getting your real	14 50 50 50 41 49 40 31
that you used it for anatomy and biochemistry and physiology	77 81 72 72 68 68 68 68 67 67
director or on actors access or some	64 67 76 76 77 49 49
are that you have to pay for to start	49 49 79 70 70 70 71 71 41
the most important thing to convey to	76 76 79 70 79 79 77
to help tell the story	40 40 67 67 67
name is Kurt you thank you so much for	41 41 41 41 41 71 68 41 71
implement the five day rule	41 41 41 41 41
your state this can take	49 40 41 41 41
full - time now if you ' re not even sure if	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
already started on the movie meaning	71 71 71 71 71 70
new marvel movie they won ' t tell you	73 76 73 41 41 41 41 41 68
talk about acting as part of your answer	76 76 67 71 71 41 68 41
same room together and part of the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
reliable enough where you don ' t need to	80 79 49 79 70 70 70 70 71
self tape auditions	21 21 1
1 , 000 true fans where if you can just	31 31 31 40 49 19 41 41 41 41
proven themselves to be ready for the	79 77 80 77 80 80 41
like new york or la or atlanta	53 53 53 53 53 53 53
losing real money	52 43 79
so they put multiple actors on first	47 49 50 50 50 50 50
you know chris hemsworth preparing for	41 40 40 40 49 49
and bigger properties all right the	80 53 43 14 40 40
moved on to the next round and you are	70 71 71 71 41 70 67 67 70
and making your profit a priority um	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actor needs to be doing whether they	80 80 80 80 49 49 49
It ' s absolutely okay to skip lectures	59 59 59 61 58 58 61 61
for the agent to work with you	49 49 49 40 40 40 40
after a few years or so in the field	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
basically two ways of selling it like we	46 49 67 73 73 76 76 76
and a good lesson that I took away from it	79 70 70 61 40 64 64 64 64 64
that have paid great wages that have	40 67 67 70 50 50 50
time just in case anything crazy comes	77 76 76 77 79 79 79
a little bit of studying every day when you ' re 19	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 79
that hard to become a real estate agent	79 79 79 79 79 70 79 79
until next time keep practicing keep	41 71 71 71 71 71
simply having an llc means you ' re still	31 40 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
marvel movie to the general public	79 79 79 79 79 79
studying for exams but with friends around me	41 41 50 50 49 50 49 49
audition from each of the actors if they	76 80 80 80 80 80 76 76
year old curt would have been like	79 79 79 79 79 79 73
it is probably much more common for	53 44 44 44 44 44 71
expenses here in los angeles so yeah i	79 79 49 49 79 79 71 49
already heard on and turn to have your	79 71 71 41 40 71 71 71
time and in the end they have to put it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
those investments again it might feel a	49 49 49 80 76 79 79
And so for example if we look at the S & amp ; P 500	49 49 34 61 61 43 40 40 49 49 49 49 49 49 79
you should be one of the first 1000 people to hit the link	79 79 79 79 79 79 67 49 49 79 79 79 79
non - union right here so remember this is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
next time keep practicing keep learning	49 41 40 40 67 67
for a final casting decision	71 71 71 71 70
or off - white tiles with the gross grout	70 52 52 52 79 79 79 76 79
as you are a nice person and you ' re not	40 40 40 40 31 31 31 40 40 40 40
conventional loan but it ' s actually	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
might be are you ready to hear what my	71 71 71 74 41 41 41 41 71
can get involved in with acting	41 41 41 41 41 41
and you ' ve just landed your first job	70 43 43 43 43 70 79 79 79
going on behind the scenes from the	79 79 79 25 79 79 79
Stick your phone on the side	58 58 59 58 58 58
so this is a great opportunity for	49 40 40 40 40 41 41
only if i work on union projects here in	40 40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49
roles that need to be cast for this	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
so we are spending much more than just	52 52 52 52 52 70 70 70
longer than you expect but the more that	49 52 41 41 41 41 41 71
next time that they get a role that fits	67 70 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
the movie has come out but I don ' t think	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
If you have any sorts of savings	49 49 40 40 31 31 31
performers and they make a great living	76 53 53 71 71 50 71
connections you have in the industry	79 79 79 79 79 79
and oftentimes those residual payments	67 71 67 70 67
or non - union so what ' s the difference	70 70 70 70 68 71 71 71 71 71
teenager said	68 68
( upbeat music )	11 11 11 11
product right well that ' s not	79 79 70 70 70 70 40
movie one last thing before we get	71 77 77 77 77 77 77
an agent or you don ' t have somebody else	49 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 40
great thing about the conventional loan	70 70 70 71 70 70
in the details what i want you guys to	79 79 79 63 61 71 70 79 79
idea of how this scene should look a cop	49 49 41 71 71 71 71 71 40
has a demo reel who can show them	71 41 40 40 40 41 41 71
even more than one brown some will have	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 80
have doubled every 10 years	79 67 64 64 64
But yeah that ' s point number 10	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
movies and the bigger roles and all of	41 41 40 49 49 50 50 50
was a male they wanted to go with a	73 73 73 73 73 73 73 73 73
two masterminds now both of those have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
next thing you guys should definitely do	46 49 40 40 31 31 31
i know la is kind of the mecca of the	79 79 79 49 49 49 79 79 79 79
going to discuss is what most people	71 71 71 50 50 50 80
on Skillshare that you ' re not gonna learn at university	19 19 10 10 10 10 19 19 19 19 19
please give them an audition now if you	50 50 50 50 50 70 67 67
up and if you haven ' t already	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
an hour that would be 80 hours of life	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
tons and tons of these questions that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that actor	79 76
1 , 000 % prepared for your auditions	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
tofu so that was it pretty short and	79 49 49 49 49 52 52 70
would basically undercut everyone else	49 41 68 49 79
so go through your script and see if you can find the parts where it would make sense	41 40 44 44 68 71 49 49 41 41 71 71 41 41 41 41 41 41
really cool because you ' re you ' re really	41 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
and try to get auditions and audition	70 70 70 70 70 80 80
much each of those things should cost	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
credits maybe at that point is a time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but basically you want to start investing	31 31 61 61 61 67 70

importantly you won ' t be a slave to your	70 70 70 70 70 40 40 79 79 79
what did I actually learn from this	79 79 79 79 79 70 79
writing and copywriting and data entry	49 67 49 49 67 76
that you ' re an agent let all your	40 40 40 40 40 40 67 67 67
it can be very complex and a lot of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
wrong city i was too far away from where	76 76 49 49 40 70 70 70 70
my paint stuff that ' s not how it works	49 49 50 41 41 41 53 53 53 53
anything what are the chances that you	49 49 40 40 70 40 41
biggest reasons why many actors don	70 70 70 79 71 71
write that off or if you ' re going to buy	31 31 31 31 31 28 28 28 28 28 31
for a lot of newer actors so um i had a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
class right now totally understandable	41 49 49 49 49
and unless you are already a proficient	71 67 67 67 68 71 71
your equity and part of that goes to	40 31 32 32 32 32 32 40
to perform a certain thing on set	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i actually worked on quite a few union	71 67 70 70 70 70 70 70
have all our dialogue pre - planned out our conversations are spontaneous	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 49 41 41
have that patience you ' re very likely to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
like how to set up your email list and	41 41 41 41 41 40 40 40 40
based on my budget of what i could	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
back in 2016 just me and my dog tofu the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that still have a full - time job and keep	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
But in terms of business and creation and YouTube	68 71 67 41 68 62 70 49 79
I want to point out two more things that	65 65 67 67 67 68 68 68 68
student films or short films things like	71 71 79 71 71 79 79
loose script	40 50
searching for the nearest big city	79 49 76 70 70 70
watched a training video on how to do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
a corporate video or an industrial video	44 44 44 44 44 44 40
is to create an online course	67 70 68 61 61 61
who hasn ' t heard it before it ' s pretty revolutionary	41 41 41 41 49 49 49 52 52 52 71 70
entire roster of actors and potentially	80 80 80 80 53 81
they do things qualitatively differently	49 70 70 70 70
while performing and that is by being a	71 71 41 41 41 41 41 71
when i lived in ohio i never wanted to	77 41 71 71 50 79 79 71 71
want to live with college students house	79 49 79 79 79 79 79
things that i wasn ' t even incorporating	79 79 79 79 79 79 76 77
I think I turned on monetization roundabout April 2018	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
in profit for the year 19 % of that goes to the government	79 79 79 79 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
don ' t have a demo reel what does your	40 40 40 40 41 41 79 79 79 79
that says this is going to be fun	49 46 49 49 49 49 76 67
so it ' s a great way to get started to	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 40 40
So the good stuff rises to the top	52 49 49 52 52 52 52 52
see all of the actions involved in the	40 50 50 50 50 50 79 76
up and hit subscribe because when you do	43 43 70 70 70 79 79 79

seven so those three oh one more thing	41 41 41 41 38 41 41 41
back to the original question	79 79 79 71 71
really go through the information	79 79 70 79 70
mistake so that your auditions	71 71 71 71 71
that ' s probably not the best use of	79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70 79
simulation questions and their answers	40 40 40 49 49
you have an apple vs . cake both are very	41 50 50 50 41 41 41 50 40 40
link you can follow along you can just	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
HD cameras but if you are using your	41 41 67 67 67 67 40 40
camera to see somebody with some life in	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you guys next time	79 79 0 0
They ' ve recently got one about uncertainty	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
roles so it	41 67 67
salary so you can put in up to 19 . 5 000	70 31 31 31 31 28 28 31 31 31 31 31
find those as well	41 41 41 41
things that people will pay you for some	80 80 80 77 76 76 49 49
This is technically not financial advice	65 70 70 70 70 70
that was step 11 . step 12	70 70 68 70 70 70 70
roi i definitely recommend assessing the	31 31 40 76 31 31
So the value of your money will have fallen	50 52 52 52 40 31 28 28 31
and and the people that those people	73 73 73 73 73 73 73
are the ones where i know the educators	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in those cities are going to get	41 41 41 43 43 43 52
prepare and then I would do that	64 64 64 64 67 67 67
into figuring out their technique	67 67 67 67 67
friends our family our local community	52 52 52 52 52 79
And the point he makes is that it ' s all just very mundane	70 70 53 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 70
marketing there are a million different	79 79 79 79 79 79
again and if meal planning is something	41 50 50 49 50 49 41
because they are they ' re maybe their top	70 41 41 41 41 41 40 40 40
and i do have a video on my youtube	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
Peter McKinnon has done very well	73 76 76 76 76 76
casting directors the advice that I	79 79 79 52 49 41
your audition in on time well something	71 71 49 40 70 70 70
or to work on that side project	67 58 37 37 0 0 0
was about 90	49 41 41
getting that audition and doing it was a	70 70 70 79 70 79 79 79
so we ' re gonna give that a three - star rating	0 0 0 0 79 79 79 52 79 79 79 79
cheat sheet until next time keep	68 68 68 64 64 77
like I want to get a first class I wanna go for rank one	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
they may put on plays in the class they	49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41
store brand product	70 70 79
reasons number one	52 52 52
make a movie or to make a television	80 71 70 70 70 70 70 70
that you ' re sort of organically getting traffic	58 60 60 60 60 60 60 59 58
want to pursue an acting career	71 71 71 71 71 71
rather than accidentally	52 52 79
they ' re probably not going to get people	70 70 70 67 67 67 67 67 70
of that so	70 70 70
conventional loan they ' re going to	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
so if you ' re interested in becoming a	70 67 67 67 67 71 71 71 71
the ground and and have my existential	73 73 73 76 31 76 79
have family members and your time and	40 43 40 40 40 71 79
as far as timing is concerned you know	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
because there were no tv shows and	53 53 53 77 77 69 77
from a financial standpoint i already	79 79 79 79 79 79
you ' re gonna see me talk about my dog	68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 71
out without leaving their own house	52 43 43 43 43 43
so this is where you would put those	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
as a dividend	79 79 79
retention is now in summary there are	31 32 40 40 40 13 13
would for example be the FTSE 100	70 67 70 61 28 28 31
non - union projects	50 50 50 50
And so you ' ve made money off of the rental income	53 53 70 70 70 53 53 51 51 54 80 40
when you first begin expect your income	40 40 40 67 40 40 40
can mention all of them here	49 49 41 41 41 41
I would think oh I ' ve got two hours before bed	53 53 50 50 50 50 50 49 76 49 50 49
in this video we ' re going to talk about	80 77 77 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
store or something like that we tend to	70 70 70 70 58 67 64 64
pretty much work on it whenever you want	3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
are much later in your career and you	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
twenty five thousand dollars and the	19 19 19 19 19 20
And anytime I ' m sort of in that mode	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 49 76 79
you can do it you usually only work with	79 79 80 79 53 52 53 53 53
sell it or get rid of it if you	52 79 70 70 70 70 61 40 70
and probably the most common question I	70 70 70 71 71 80 71
cast or a crew member the pace of the	76 76 76 76 76 77 41 49 49
questions feel free to leave them down	37 40 40 68 71 71 44
actors from acting teachers from	71 68 77 50 77
tock instagram anything that can really	79 79 79 79 79 79

Surely everyone would know about it	49 49 71 41 71 49
are not a background performer you	40 40 40 49 49 40
around about 12 , 500 views	41 41 76 76 76 76
to think about the sort of fun that takes some suffering	70 70 68 68 73 73 76 73 76 76 76
advantages of having a high credit score	53 44 44 44 71 71 44

also in general like it ' s easy to say	76 70 70 67 70 70 70 71 43 49
that you can take	53 53 50 80
thoughts and if i	79 79 76 79
point is to where	79 79 79 76
consistent and so I always worked at a	50 49 49 49 49 50 22 23
premium that FHA loans have so that	71 40 70 71 71 71 71
look more real on camera see ya next time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
career aspirations	79 50

So how hard is it to get started making digital products	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 49
and when you do that you can write off	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
getting out of your comfort zone believe	70 70 61 79 79 79 79

forgoing investing that money right now	79 79 79 40 79 79
casting director will probably say hey	70 70 70 70 67 67
actually sees through its lens this is	71 71 71 71 49 79 79
where ' s all the life that we supposedly	51 51 51 79 70 70 70 79 79
their business as a side hustle	79 79 79 79 79 79
our body naturally does and a lot of the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

Apple is now trading at $	61 79 79 48 49 49

are ways where you can actually get	67 71 77 77 50 80 50
you don ' t make a lot of Commission but	49 49 49 49 49 52 80 53 40 40
you book just one in 10 auditions in	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
they ' re really talented because check	51 51 51 51 51 51 51
example a 50	79 79 79
with this sort of effectively a hangover from staying	79 79 79 79 79 76 77 76 76

social media was made to be social but	79 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
a good lesson	79 79 79
time house hacker the best deals are	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
lot of actors who	71 71 71 71
you can do for them and what your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
there ' s not a single person who imagine	67 67 67 67 67 71 71 71 67
actually have control over	80 80 80 77
the photo based on some calculations but	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
is bigger pockets they have a website	71 21 21 21 12 12 11
fortunately self - taping is not rocket	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
so don ' t invite people into your network	76 76 76 76 67 64 76 76 76
it ' s generally 30 days of escrow and	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
so that means that you ' re just going to	71 71 68 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
make money in this industry and the	71 71 71 71 71 67 76
relationship for it ' s an opportunity to	76 76 76 76 76 76 79 76
exceptions oftentimes someone will tell	79 79 76 79 79
everyone knows at least one realistic	67 64 64 67 71 71
Obviously varies massively	58 59 61
about how to get stuff done	49 49 49 76 76 76
another way that actors make money in	79 79 79 71 71 71 40
but the nice thing is again once you ' ve got that formula	49 79 41 40 40 41 41 50 50 50 49 49 49
one day they they said hey we actually	71 71 71 71 67 70 70 76
something else full	79 79 79
That ' s like one way of doing it	49 49 49 49 49 46 50 41 41
the next thing we ' re going to talk about	70 67 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
week but i would say	70 67 67 67 67
but in the beginning	80 50 50 50
your routinized I don ' t know maybe	49 49 40 40 40 40 40 50
So in general for most YouTubers	79 79 67 67 67 67
if you don ' t have a storage unit it	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 41 41
teacher and many other potential roles	49 49 79 79 79 79
clarity the two that we ' re going to talk	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
know necessarily what your goals are	19 19 19 19 19 19
doing this but just to simplify for	41 41 41 51 0 0 0
and then just go like that back and	49 40 40 40 40 40 67 67
So you might as well not even try	76 76 70 41 49 49 49 49
storytellers whether it ' s a movie a	40 40 70 70 70 70 70 53
The next question is usually	71 70 49 70 70
do with that	79 79 49
post it on Instagram on on Facebook on	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
three forms of value that people will	49 49 49 49 49 49 67
if you wanna have a read in more detail	43 43 43 52 52 52 52 52 52
part that no one actually cares about	42 40 40 32 32 40 40
does reduce focus very very slightly	79 76 68 68 67 68
know you ' re a runner you probably want	46 46 46 46 40 40 49 49 49
video guys if you liked it please give	76 68 68 68 68 68 41 71
you make on the side that actually	71 80 80 80 53 53 53
really get appreciation	40 40 40
either into Notion projects or into to - do list items	49 49 70 49 52 49 49 49 49 49 49
this is an easy question to answer i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
based on what we ' ve seen	50 41 41 41 41 41 41
that makes sense because companies are trying to connect with their audiences	41 41 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
of the professional tools	40 40 40 40
well - known and well - respected casting	71 71 71 49 79 79 79 79
links to buckingham Fitness his website	76 76 76 76 76 76
non - union productions that have made me	71 71 71 71 70 70 70 70
okay those were 10 ways to gain	41 41 41 41 71 71 71
wealth to build your net worth and	79 52 79 79 71 79 79

is going to help you once you transition	79 79 79 79 79 79 49 80
from actingcareercenter	71 71
house is now worth	20 20 20 20
buying a house is a little bit annoying	31 31 58 40 40 40 67 67
there ' s some confusion regarding this	77 77 77 50 41 41 41
a good income	79 79 79
look i feel like i say this in almost	49 49 49 49 71 71 44 41 44
two roles for cops one was a sheriff and	73 73 73 73 49 49 49 49 50
now one thing that you might do is that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
So I spent six years at university studying medicine	79 79 79 79 81 81 80 80 81
to succeed in real estate you do not	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
but i ' m not holding my breath and here	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 41 41
and they have to decide and pick 20 or	76 76 76 77 51 50 77 76 80
at the workplace	0 0 0
and I can use it personally however much I want	51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51
is what ' s the best place to live to	67 67 67 67 70 70 70 70 70 40
someone as a graphic designer and you	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
or if you see people in the comments	41 41 41 41 79 79 49 49
interest rates	70 70
yourself and how you responded	71 71 79 79 0
It ' s just sort of sitting in my bank account	34 34 34 34 40 61 49 76 67 70 67
you got two recommendations and one	71 71 52 52 52 79
this video	71 71
And you ' re gonna be thinking like everyone does	52 79 79 79 79 43 43 53 79 79
seeing success so without further ado	51 33 33 79 79 79
And this is from David Allen ' s book Getting Things Done	50 50 50 49 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
all my family calls it because we ' re so	42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42
and and seeing that on a resume so if	40 40 41 41 41 41 50 50
And so for example an index fund with a 0 . 1 % fee	52 52 25 25 52 79 52 34 70 49 49 49 49 76
who are very kindly sponsoring this video	61 61 61 1 1 0 0
high rate of appreciation then very	44 44 44 71 40 40
here in atlanta it only cost	71 71 77 80 71 71
a PMI payment of 0 . 45 and then say	71 71 71 67 71 71 71 70 70 70
then there are probably other casting	19 79 79 79 71 71
of 15 people on $ 50 , 000 it ' s different	79 53 80 80 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
and what rents you should expect it also	79 70 79 70 70 79 79 79
okay you sold me on this idea of investing in index funds	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 61 79 49 49 79
the instant you turn on your channel	41 49 50 50 40 40 40
lot of money per month that isn	70 62 62 61 62 70 79
So it makes such a big change	37 40 40 49 40 40 40
tax write - offs or strategies that	49 40 40 40 40 40 49
you started Buckingham Fitness and how	49 49 49 49 49 50
want to do one workout a week two three	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
already started taking your real estate	22 41 41 41 41 40
mean anything that ' s the name of the	52 52 52 52 52 76 76 67 67
be forced to join the union so	71 71 71 50 50 50 77
they ' re going to be changing lines	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
advice every single week well	71 71 71 71 49
I wanna realize I could do	71 71 71 67 67 67
say blocks	79 79
actually like one of the highest	0 79 79 79 79 79
doing that that can make a reasonable	27 54 54 27 27 27 27
So for example they get really low prices	67 67 67 67 67 41 50 50
I know that any time I talk about her it	41 41 41 76 76 76 49 49 49 68
in real estate	31 31 31
you want to pay that off as soon as possible	28 28 1 1 1 31 31 31 58 67
years ago I was in London for work so	68 77 77 77 76 79 79 70 79
for their actors and that is again	68 41 41 41 41 41 41
that doesn ' t necessarily mean that you	73 68 68 68 80 77 77 77
vast majority of auditions the casting	0 0 0 0 0 0
over a thousand of these questions and	49 49 49 40 10 31 40
here ' s not worse so the first thing we	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a lot of other things i say for most	44 31 31 31 31 40 40 40 40
is about 1 000 per day for the actor so	50 77 68 71 71 71 40 40 70 70
things like that where no you ' re not	50 41 50 49 50 50 50 50 50
being the first agent that people think	79 70 70 70 79 79 52
and there your little corner yesterday gabriel pixie	71 71 71 71 71 71 80 79
And so let ' s talk about	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
Basically a place where you can capture ideas and things	70 70 70 67 67 67 67 67 22 22
instead of getting a script	40 43 71 71 43
will just have it and friends never dead	79 80 80 80 77 76 76 76
I mean my positioning is almost exactly	70 67 67 67 67 71 31
you learn the skills you need to break	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because you bought high and you sold low	67 67 67 67 67 70 49 79
same quartz countertops these are	0 0 0 0 0
investing out of state	31 31 31 40
if you ' re investing in individual stock	70 70 70 70 77 50 50 49
especially at the start of your career	40 40 67 67 67 41 40
that you are committed the first way to	68 68 68 68 67 67 71 71
interacting with another human being	40 40 40 71 71
um and you ' re at that tipping point	79 52 79 79 79 79 79 80 71
doing more stuff you ' ll be doing maybe a	76 76 76 73 73 73 73 76 76 76
furnace room blare up because that takes	19 19 19 49 41 41 41
is zero percent	47 51 47
so i didn ' t really have the financial	70 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
any questions alright until next time	41 68 49 49 49 49
is the only time on an acting resume	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
finding some type of exam preparation	40 44 40 50 40 40
of keeping it so for example this	37 40 40 41 41 49 49
that a lot of the questions on the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
with 30 seconds of only crying or 30	37 37 40 44 44 40 73 73
essentially took one of our website	79 79 79 76 79 79
towards inviting people to your room to hang out	50 41 44 41 41 41 41 41 41
opportunity meets preparation	49 52 52
i think at least 10 000 saved up in the	79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70
save easily 20	49 49 76
from the cheapest one to the most	41 41 41 41 40 31 31
actors in ohio	77 80 80
but you get a chance again to gain	50 50 41 41 50 41 41 41
probably wasting your money on we ' ll go	0 79 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
this whole social media thing and that	52 79 79 79 79 79 79
character or	40 40
if you treat everyone you meet with with	64 64 67 76 76 49 41 40
get an audition you better know how to	40 70 70 49 53 50 50 50
negative don ' t talk about how you just	71 71 71 71 79 70 71 71 71
spirits with soldiers stories one help	50 50 80 80 40 40
your career without a talent agent is	71 71 79 79 79 79 79
that the agents most most of them if	49 49 46 46 49 49 46 46
is by selling digital products	53 53 53 54 44
for a project	0 0 0
said anything about shaq all i knew was	67 70 70 70 50 41 41 49
see you on monday i	71 71 68 41 80
a background actor	64 41 40
going to be different for every single	79 79 79 71 79 79 79
So you know you actually could film an online course	49 50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 40
digital products really are the way to	52 52 52 52 52 52 46
casting directors	79 0
the right person for the part	76 76 71 70 71 49
for instance bfa musical theater you put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you ' re staying top of mind for	73 73 73 73 73 73 73 76
documented as well this means you	40 79 40 40 40 40
implement that content you know seeing	79 79 49 49 49 49
estate course and pass the final exam	67 40 50 22 40 67 40
number six is to make sure the actor is	1 1 10 0 0 0 0 0 0
able to make your payments and for them	41 41 41 41 40 31 31 40
per month and yeah that ' s a very easy	79 70 43 43 70 70 70 70 79 79
tell them you ' re uncomfortable with	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
really valuable resources and I can send	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to discover their content the more they ' re likely	76 80 79 76 76 71 70 70 70 71
Oh and one more thing	79 76 76 77 79
And so the general tip here is that like think about	52 52 52 52 41 40 76 76 76 76 67
so that they all came through here and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
an article today that said	80 80 80 80 20
if I totally let myself go and start looking like jabba the hutt	79 79 79 80 68 68 71 71 79 79 79 79 79
" like why are you still working	68 68 67 67 67 67 67
big bookshelves in your house and yet	25 25 52 52 79 70 70

haven ' t already remember to subscribe to	65 65 65 68 68 71 71 71
And naturally there is the anxiety	70 31 31 62 61 52
All of those courses and thousands more	50 50 41 41 41 50 79
actual food itself so like when you know	50 41 50 50 41 41 41 41
the class you ' re learning a ton of stuff	58 31 31 31 31 79 34 61 58 58
didn ' t have to go to work would we still	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 79 70

get an audition that that says it takes	70 71 71 68 67 67 71 71
had the goal when i started my business	79 79 79 79 71 71 79 79
in the next five to 10 years at least	49 49 49 40 40 40 67 67 67

All of these are things that I ' ve mentioned	80 80 80 80 76 76 79 79 79 79
for joining me here today	71 71 71 71 71
those traits quite yet and i feel like	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
should be fairly easy as long as you use	79 79 79 71 71 71 71 71 68
have a reasonable internet connection	0 0 0 0 0

It ' s just that people are slowly attritioning over time	65 65 65 65 65 68 65 65 65 65 65
So again a little bit of work every day	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the last thing i want to say on this	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
monologues should come later in an	26 26 26 26 26 53
people having a smaller space means it	79 71 53 79 79 71 43
suggest both a police officer and a	50 50 81 80 41 70 70
money for that skill or service now	76 67 67 76 49 49 49
resume one quick tip	77 77 50 50
so a real estate agent is actually a	70 40 40 40 40 67 70 67
costco has a very generous return policy	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and because of that it typically costs	41 70 70 70 40 77 71
I ' ve had lots of messages over the years	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and maybe sand down the surface and	79 79 76 77 78 79 79
then making a steady income is probably	67 40 40 40 40 40 67
26 years old so i started	79 79 79 79 79 79
sag after a website	71 71 71 71
James Bond I must be too good	52 52 52 52 52 52 52
that link is in the description below	41 41 68 68 71 79 80
Okay so we ' ve talked about what a share is	67 61 40 40 40 1 0 0 0 0 0
now if you ' re trying to move to new york	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
Point number 10 is something that I came up with	79 52 41 40 49 67 70 79 79 50
have been taking this seriously	79 79 41 49 52
you know exactly when you ' re working out	40 41 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
to get up at 5 a . m . and other days you	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 22 22 22
it is a good way to meet a lot of people	40 40 37 37 37 40 40 40 40 40 13
them that you	53 50 50
to book you for a role in the movie it	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 69
now another option to kind of save some	71 71 70 71 71 71 71 71
And obviously this has taken me	49 49 79 79 58 58
with Sarah ' s character for audition	40 40 40 40 40 67 71
products i think that ' s super ridiculous	79 70 70 40 40 40 41 79
show you how to	0 0 0 0
want to consistently do practice	40 13 40 40 41
and pointless coffee and pointless takeaway	0 0 19 10 11 1
you learn your lines faster recently I	67 67 67 67 71 49 49
goal and that ' s not to say that general	37 49 49 49 49 49 46 46 49 50
that young and i guess it ' s possible	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
write so when we actually write	0 0 0 0 0 0
maker and then just do it yourself same	79 61 61 79 79 79 79 79
and that is booking the room let me	77 77 77 80 80 77 77 77
created a list of self taping tools on	70 49 70 76 70 70 70 67
which I can not control the courage to change what I can	71 71 79 79 79 71 71 71 41 41 41 41
every year only a very small percentage	70 70 67 67 67 70 70
don ' t know 1 % 2 % 3 % Commission on that	53 53 53 53 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
happens to fit well then you ' ve got a	41 41 41 43 43 50 50 50 50 50
you know the director is gonna tell me	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
the steps you need to take	40 40 40 40 40 40
videos up there so if you have an imdb	49 49 41 40 40 40 41 41 68
are taking home from these videos	67 67 67 67 68 67
if everybody is telling them that here	71 71 67 67 70 70 70
you wanna make love to you if we got	44 44 53 26 26 26 26 53 53
And so in one evening we just managed to get this done	59 59 67 40 76 76 77 77 46 46 49 49
upload then you can get this free tool	67 71 71 70 70 70 70 70
okay got it let ' s do it and then we did	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 79
because it ' s not the same sort of fun	76 76 76 76 70 70 67 67 67 70
in california that ' s going to be 135	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
should go full time and all of that so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49
about the audition preparation process	41 41 41 71 71
no I ' m gonna focus on finding the title roles that fit my look	71 71 71 71 71 68 68 68 41 41 41 71 41 41 41
the audition was for	49 70 70 49

why this wasn ' t just a massive flex	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then you can start just putting money in here and there	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

what others think about you or even what	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
and a self taped audition what should	70 70 70 71 71 79 52
getting a loan for	11 11 11 11
you have so much freedom in your	80 80 80 80 80 52 79
I have to look at the screen to see	49 49 49 67 67 67 67 67 67
anytime I ' ve had a situation in my life	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 76
units and even better is a fourplex	79 70 79 79 70 70 79
their actors that fit this particular	49 49 49 76 76 76
all of my friends that I was gonna be	79 79 76 76 73 73 73 73 76
your personality looks on camera it	76 76 74 74 74 67
really drill it into my head so let	37 37 37 40 67 67 41 49
from a copywriter to a videographer to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
today so why is every audition a win	79 52 61 61 61 61 61 61
what if you already live in california	80 80 80 80 53 53 53
they ' re definitely the most affordable	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
have a huge advantage it ' s very hard for	50 53 53 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
in about 90 days and it ' s for sure the	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
important to go into this field with the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
charging more and more especially as you	49 46 49 46 76 50 41
pushing pause and that doesn ' t allow me	67 41 40 40 40 40 40 40 67
know I ' m not certified that ' s not what I	46 46 46 46 46 50 49 49 49 50 50 50
so the point is this uncapped income is	79 71 70 79 79 70 79 79
how every audition is a win right and i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
well i ' ve actually created a free	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 70
these types of real estate questions so	70 79 70 79 79 79 70
should always be looking out for the	80 80 79 79 52 52 79
what I will do is I ' ll grab a notebook	50 50 50 50 50 67 67 67 67 67 49
And the point that they were making in this podcast	37 37 37 37 70 70 70 70 43 53
that skill to other	0 0 12 49
way not only because it can ' t be taken	49 49 49 68 71 71 71 71 71 71
I ' m gonna give this a five out of five - star rating	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a project do they still get paid and the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in front of their store it is the	43 67 70 70 70 71 68 70
could have gone so then if you could do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
hire i ' m willing to pay my own travel	80 77 77 77 77 77 79 79 79 79
that you never knew existed	64 64 64 70 71
countries as well we ' ll have	41 41 41 41 41 41 49
So with that caveat $ 12 , 000 a month passive income	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
live six days a week issue to do that	49 41 40 40 40 47 47 41 50
just so you can see how this works	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and i could kind of leisurely pursue	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
first of all let me welcome those of you	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
this also applies if you ' re a student	76 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
nobody starts their basketball career by	67 70 70 70 67 67
throughout their	49 49
do you have to live in los angeles or	71 71 50 50 50 81 81 81 80
representatives for all the negotiations	40 67 67 31 67
I ' d kind of write down all the subjects I need just to know	49 49 49 41 50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 0 0 0
great five minute long story to tell	49 49 49 49 71 71 71
you add these two things up you ' re gonna	1 28 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
And so depending on the topic	0 0 0 0 0 0
it easier when people so that ' s why I	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
you can choose individual stocks	31 31 31 31 31
as one dollar a month of mental	40 40 40 40 41 40 40
roommate and the net cost was much lower	71 63 63 63 63 71 70 70
and then it was student films and indie	67 67 40 40 64 67 67 64
support your business for three to six	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
there ' s nothing there then i will	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 61
may or may not regret doing	79 79 79 79 79 79
close to you the premise of the 48 hour	68 68 50 71 71 41 71 71 71
old now you can ' t just pay them for not	76 40 40 1 1 1 31 31 31 31 40
of course it ' s annoying because you have	49 49 49 49 49 40 40 40 49
another task as well then you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
people who don ' t really want to be in	40 40 46 46 46 40 46 46 46 46
here in north america the most commonly	0 0 0 79 79 79 79
is a topic for another day that ' s a	40 49 40 50 50 71 71 71 71 71
you know there ' s one thing that actors tend to do in auditions	71 79 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49 49 49 49 41

hey guys so in this video we are going	71 70 49 49 49 49 49 49 68
you need to be providing 25 pieces of	70 76 76 76 76 76 77 68
what i would recommend is doing a scene	41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40
knows about this house is this gigantic	79 79 80 53 53 51 79
their services period so be sure to do	71 71 70 79 79 52 70 71
" in health and socially positive attitudes and behaviors	79 79 79 79 79 40 37 40 67

talent agents a few months ago i made a	71 71 71 71 79 79 79 79 70
The real question is how hard is it to actually	41 41 41 41 41 41 49 49 41 41
this needs to be painful and if it ' s painful	49 49 47 47 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
oftentimes they can only extend audition	80 77 77 77 80 79
anything online is by using attention	49 49 49 79 79 49
maths science and computer science the	0 0 0 0 0 0
with multiple people so that you get to	43 43 40 40 40 40 40 40
common example is a training video	41 41 41 41 41 41
so my point is while you shouldn ' t be comparing yourself to	44 79 71 71 40 40 70 70 70 70 71 71 53
class you can	70 40 64
the audition room I was running the	41 71 71 71 71 19 19
lot of these things you can do yourself	49 49 49 79 79 79 71 79
through this another five or ten times	67 71 70 79 79 79 0
and i had opportunities to make money	53 77 44 71 71 71 71
only one short scene	71 71 71 79
sell your first house quicker than that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
we enjoy more or even to stop working	0 2 2 37 37 32 0 0
or 15 - year course of the mortgage once	67 40 40 40 49 79 79 43 79
benchpress because you know you got to	49 49 49 49 49 49 19
But secondly and more importantly	50 49 52 79 79
making money in real estate works	41 41 41 41 41 40
really enjoys it so yeah thank you guys	40 19 50 71 53 53 53 53
seriously you cannot tell a difference	41 49 79 70 71 71
end up booking that role	76 76 76 76 76
have to pay all of those extra costs so	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 67 68
all the video ideas that I might have	67 67 49 70 79 52 52 52
fits each role so for simplicity ' s sake	37 40 40 41 49 49 49 49 49
Happy New Year all of that good stuff	79 79 52 52 79 79 79 76
that house prices tend to rise over the longterm	58 55 58 58 31 31 31 31 61

or if you live in a city that doesn	50 79 79 79 79 79 80 50 80

This is called the Muhammad Ali method	50 50 49 49 49 49 49
in the hope that it ' s going to bring us	52 52 52 52 79 79 79 79 70 71 79
it kind of shows it looks like time pass	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

failure then your body isn ' t as taxed	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
All we know is that in the longterm	67 67 67 67 70 49 49 49
the really important parts look at the	79 79 79 79 79 76 79
And so the question becomes	76 76 76 67 67
in this video before getting started so	79 79 79 79 79 79 52
For some of these websites and some of these apps	70 70 71 71 71 71 70 70 43 61
well the higher your credit score the	61 70 70 61 61 70 71
haven ' t already and if you ' re a newer	67 67 67 67 40 40 67 67 67 67 67
If you ' re going down the Skillshare route	31 31 31 31 0 0 0 0 21

sorting out the to - do list cleaning the desk	53 53 76 76 76 76 67 64 76 70
you ' re not seeing any of those auditions	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

don ' t know	41 41 41 71
there ' s tons of things you can do to	40 40 40 44 44 44 44 44 44 53

people that you know we really really	70 52 79 79 79 79 79

and that would leave me with 6750	80 79 79 79 79 79 79
my rule of thumb is to generally avoid	68 68 40 40 41 41 49 40
interested in you might want to look	41 40 40 40 41 71 71
walk over and just address the patient	79 79 49 49 79 79 79

sure to get those reprinted on 8 by 10	71 71 71 68 70 41 71 71 71
but it ' s completely worth it and i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

to have the listing and that ' s where	43 43 52 79 79 79 79 79 79
they wake up on time every day and do it	67 64 67 67 67 67 67 64 64 64

then you also become eligible and then	40 40 40 40 43 71 71
because you ' ll learn as you do it and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
auditions 10 percent that means 90	71 71 71 71 67 70
because the average american spends	43 70 21 1 0

you ' re asking someone to buy stuff and	76 76 76 67 67 67 67 67 76
so same thing with an actor once you say	76 49 40 40 40 40 67 67 70

what you ' ve done especially here in the	53 71 71 71 71 70 70 70 70

look at this resume that we ' ve just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
again it was right for me and i know	40 40 40 50 50 50 49 49 49

that ' s gonna mean that you ' re paying	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
And then you see how far they can go	67 76 46 46 49 41 49 49 52
learning how to act	71 71 71 71
out the door and they ' re going to give	67 67 67 50 41 41 41 41 41 71

exams that are based on the topics that	40 40 40 13 22 49 49 49
wage but it also applies to people	40 49 49 40 40 40 40
that you are	79 79 71
this time with the director in the room	44 71 44 44 70 71 71 71
will put my audition sides on my	67 67 40 40 40 67 49
that ' s a lot harder try three of them go	49 49 49 49 49 40 49 49 49 49 49
to see results people think we ' ll I ate	32 32 32 41 32 37 37 37 37 37

personality because the last thing you	52 52 41 71 71 71
lines memorized for that audition a mark	79 79 80 79 79 71 71
all of those got destroyed overnight	79 79 79 79 79 79
catastrophic happens like your car	79 79 67 79 79
Edison bulb but it wasn ' t too blue and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 34 79
doesn ' t mean that you should move	41 41 41 41 71 71 71 71

how ' s my behavior changed as a result of reading this thing	67 67 67 40 49 79 71 71 20 77 49 49 49
about memorization techniques	40 41 41

and some strategies you can use yourself	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

prospecting a lot you need to run ads	76 76 79 76 76 49 76 76

live in one of them and rent out the	31 31 61 61 61 70 70 52 79

i should be pinned for it and i was in	73 73 76 76 76 73 73 73 73 73
how what they do on a day - to - day basis	49 40 40 40 40 40 70 70 70 70 70 67
old - school like oak cabinets paint them	79 79 79 79 70 71 79 79
and simply because of the sheer numbers	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
into the film and television industry	68 68 71 71 71 71
actor a third way to get experience	41 40 49 41 41 41 41
if you ' re doing a ton and a ton of deals	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 32 41 41
and they want you to pay them five	79 76 67 67 67 67 68 68
getting an agent	81 81 81
didn ' t get the part	71 71 71 71 71 71
and knowing what steps to take	70 79 70 71 71 79
one of those actors who gets to the new	53 53 53 50 50 53 50 50 50
being a vegetarian it didn ' t work for me	41 40 40 32 41 41 41 32 32 41
cost three thousand dollars	49 49 71 71
matters because if you don ' t know why	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
routines whether it ' s with our sleep	38 38 38 38 38 38 38 38
not going anywhere I ' m staying right	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
when you do pass it off to someone your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
Sort of like what Amazon used to do in	79 76 70 70 70 70 70 70 76
we did some of the script but then we	22 40 40 40 40 43 70 67 64

i would recommend that you wait until	76 79 80 80 77 76 76
and elizabeth ' s website templates as	71 70 70 70 79 79 79
And so for me I often think about like the tools	71 71 71 71 68 64 64 71 71 71 71
pay as much it ' s the truth that theater	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
advertisements so this is another way	79 40 40 40 40 40
that promises that they can make you a	70 70 79 79 71 71 71 71
clients are coming in	49 40 40 49
characters and then perform that scene	40 67 76 76 79 79
didn ' t have to work	0 0 0 0 0 0
compulsively check their phones	41 44 49 79
no credits on your resume you have no	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
accumulate more and more clutter the	40 79 79 77 77 49
everybody should be doing it as long as	49 49 49 49 49 49 41 46
maybe have a guest interview or two a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
the more amount of money you can save	52 79 70 79 79 70 70 70
that ' s great if you ' re an overnight	41 41 41 41 50 50 50 50 50 50
they got to a point where you know	46 46 46 49 49 49 46 23
that the image file on the computer is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
screaming and yelling and anger that	79 80 80 80 52 71
the first takeaway is that and i	38 41 41 41 49 49 49
speaking role in a major movie the movie	81 0 0 37 37 71 71 71
that or they choose not to between	43 71 71 70 71 71 71
one is unexpected vacancies can you	40 49 49 76 49 49
people so that you know the people who	79 71 71 79 79 79 79 79
the stuff that i created with my friends	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 67
fit the role and this happens all the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
reel where should you put it so that	49 49 49 49 49 50 50 50
to seventeen thousand dollars	79 71 71 79
These days the vast majority of my online courses	37 64 64 76 67 40 31 40 40
make sure you get a credit card and use	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
more money but you ' re gonna have an	70 40 40 64 64 64 64 67 67
is an explosion that happens during your	71 71 70 70 70 67 68
times so i didn ' t lie to you i did not	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
opinion getting a real estate license is	79 79 79 70 70 79 79
okay so before you start thinking about	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
marketing tool as an actor now I ' ve seen	80 79 79 79 79 80 41 41 41 49

friends and family buy places as well	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and it ' s like following the website for years	49 49 49 49 76 76 76 76 76 76
The only way to make money is by providing value	52 25 25 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

lot of the oscar - winning and emmy	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
audition so in a way they do decide who	76 76 76 77 76 76 76 76 76
So for example	67 67 64
your experience level and we ' re gonna	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

photographer is someone with industry	79 79 49 70 79
But we do have other options to try	71 71 53 53 53 53 53 71
And so it ' s sort of passive income for him	49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 41 40
we ' re gonna give the difficulty of starting	49 49 49 49 22 49 49 49 1
And right now it would be 3	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

great way	71 71
guys it ' s Kurt from small market after	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

that so when i joined the union here in	71 79 70 43 43 41 71 71 71
your kids already in college	70 43 43 61 61
an imdb pro account costs 150	71 71 71 67 67 70
probably not but it might have helped it	41 68 59 68 59 59 59 59
And apparently you can expect to make	10 11 11 11 0 2 3
and making it your mission to read them	0 70 70 70 71 71 70 79
um for very much longer and you have the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80 80
room we can ' t control whether or not we	79 67 67 67 67 67 70 70 70 70
submissions of the actors that don	67 67 67 70 67 67
But if we look at the stats then it ' s the top 20	79 79 52 52 25 25 52 52 43 43 43 43 52 52
then starting from scratch	50 49 41 41
back to your goals like my goal right	41 41 40 31 32 32 41 40
you are looking at a state i definitely	49 76 49 40 31 31 40 40
for commercials as well because of the	79 71 71 71 67 70 71
fact I use them pretty regularly in my	71 70 70 70 70 70 71 71
So when it comes to making money from this	50 50 77 79 79 79 79 79 79
to advertisers through their Google Ads programme	67 67 67 64 64 67 37
specifically two things acting in the	70 70 79 50 50 80
fact you could do everything right you	70 0 0 0 0 0 0
the crew was getting ready to shoot and	37 46 46 46 46 46 49 49
so have your Realtor run some comps on	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that I learned was to always be ready to	68 68 68 67 67 67 70 70 70
very successful if you put in your full	67 67 67 73 64 64 67 40
you have to do is go on to facebook and	67 67 70 70 70 67 67 70 70 49
a zero cost of maintenance as well all	76 76 49 40 40 40 40 40
and that side hustle eventually evolved	70 61 61 61 61 79
good in here and then from the kitchen	43 43 43 43 49 79 79 79
i knew that i wanted to get into real	10 10 10 10 31 40 40 13 22
I you know this is gonna help me out a	41 50 50 50 50 41 50 41 41 41
think you can do it part - time but if you	79 70 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 52 79
matter if you ' re a service based	50 68 68 68 68 68 68 68
you are saving money all right number	43 49 79 79 79 70 70
better be sure	41 40 50
animated movies animated shows you could	67 71 71 49 49 49
what happened	49 49
puts down 6 % and when you ' re looking at	70 70 79 79 71 49 49 49 49 71 71
guys it ' s not a big hassle	49 49 49 49 71 71 41 10
specifically how to memorize your lines	49 49 40 40 40 41

god of war and with mirrors world ends	71 71 71 68 68 71 71 71
where there is dialogue between two	40 40 40 40 40 40
And I find that it ' s also a good model for me	40 40 40 40 64 64 64 67 67 67 49 49 49
isn ' t that much time available that	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
around it but at the end of the day you	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
you will know that your money loses its value over time	67 70 79 80 80 71 71 71 71 70 67
so that you will stand out when	41 41 41 41 41 41 67
should do it and secondly because money	80 80 80 53 80 80 80

a lot of business owners	79 79 79 79 79
station set that we were shooting in and	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
i don ' t think that is the smartest way	40 40 40 40 40 40 49 49 41 40
uh black widow right there just dropped	41 41 23 23 23 41 41
that we have to take in order	67 67 67 67 67 67 64

so i was really excited when i found out	41 40 40 41 41 41 41 41 41
whereby it almost feels like playing a video game	32 32 37 46 37 10 19 19 19
for that investment	71 51 51
It ' s like oh my God that ' s incredible	76 76 76 70 70 71 71 52 52 52 79
pay any money but	71 71 71 53
to get to 1 , 000 subscribers	41 41 41 49 49 49 49

never auditioned for that role i	79 79 80 53 53 53
the actual photo and there are things	79 52 52 52 76 77 77
specialist certification shirt so I ' m a	41 50 49 41 40 40 40 40
it ' s hard when you	79 79 79 79 79 79
and make a plan before you make the jump	44 41 41 41 41 41 71 49 49

whatever these it ' s a lot better anyways	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
school plays or anything where you can	70 70 71 71 67 67 67
casting websites are actors access	43 70 67 70 67

how you	41 41
I was thinking I posted on Instagram	67 70 70 79 79 79 79
get an audition now audition taping	71 71 71 71 71 71
And so if I wanna make money through Skillshare affiliates	41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40 41 40
zero cost of distribution and hopefully	50 50 50 49 49 76
feeling and how the body is moving and	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50
the principal actor would be on the set	40 40 40 40 70 70 67 37
freedom to record it however I wanted my	49 49 49 44 71 71 41 41
tutorial on how to create an acting	71 71 71 71 67 67 70
Well this kind of depends because it depends	55 55 55 58 58 58 58 58

train future doctors so	79 79 79 79
having a professional headshot not only	68 67 67 73 76 76
maybe this step	31 31 31
that I need to master the boring fundamentals	79 70 79 79 52 49 49 50
big budget 100 million dollar project	79 79 79 79 79 79
you have done your job	71 71 71 71 68
In that scenario in that doomsday scenario	70 70 70 67 70 70 70
starbucks and you ' re just spending five	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 79
probably aren ' t taking right now and	31 28 28 28 31 40 40 31
or one in five people are actually watching	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
years later and with a ton of failures	1 -29 28 28 28 28 28 49
it ' s made a lot of people very rich and	1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
as subscribers as opposed to you don	79 79 79 79 76 79 79
like six months from now or a year from	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And the third problem with this whole narrative	50 49 76 76 77 76 76 76
clicking that link right up there	25 71 71 71 71 71
So clearly you know if those stats	58 61 61 61 0 0 0
where I felt stressed or I felt unmotivated	67 70 70 70 43 43 70 70
and then if they like what they see then	49 49 49 49 49 76 76 76 76
We ' re gonna give that a two out of five stars	58 58 58 58 58 49 49 49 49 50 50 50
becoming financially stable before	79 79 79 79
good - looking enough for some parts but	31 31 31 31 67 71 71 77
very first one so the first thing that i	79 79 79 79 49 79 79 79 79
week three hours I ' m guessing that the	50 46 46 50 50 50 50 23 23
audition I ' ve heard many auditions where	71 71 71 71 49 53 49 73
if you ' re in that less than 10 percent	77 77 77 77 77 77 78 78 72 71
for actors who want to grow their	79 79 50 50 77 77 50

subscribe to this channel and until next	70 40 49 49 49 49 70
at any time right it doesn ' t have to	41 40 40 41 41 41 41 41 41 37
that sounds pretty easy right getting	70 70 70 70 70 49
It took me 52 videos six months to get there	41 41 41 41 41 49 49 41 41 41
about Productivity for Creators	49 52 49 79
a desk	31 31
might want to say i ' m going to create x	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you ' re traveling when you travel you	31 31 31 40 76 49 49 43
wait for those prices to go down	70 70 61 61 61 61 70
and figure out where I can apply leverage	49 49 49 49 49 49 46 37
look if you really believe that you must be good looking to become a successful	71 71 68 68 68 41 41 71 50 79 76 41 71 49 49
hundreds of dollars sometimes over a	77 77 77 77 77 77
your headshot is your most important	77 77 77 77 77 77
the more you cram the worse your	10 1 1 10 10 31 31
trust i know without a doubt you	80 79 79 79 79 80 80
to be getting better as an	50 50 80 50 71 80
for one of the lead characters one of	76 79 70 79 79 79 79 79
you may be allowed to get those	40 67 40 40 40 41 50
and that ' s something that profit first	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
freakin cool gray selfie habbid home	71 71 71 71 79 79
services are probably	71 71 71
One of them is Skillshare	40 40 40 40 40
convenience until your time becomes	79 79 79 79 79
this new role that was written into the	71 68 68 71 71 71 71 71
and a professional resume	79 79 76 76
and then you can buy shares in a company through that	67 67 70 40 37 31 31 51 51 51 51
get started	70 70
on my project	71 71 67
roof all these things are going to not	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 31
longer to recover so go just before	41 41 41 49 49 49 49
so test out all the streaming services	70 70 61 61 61 61 61
i mean that ' s the power of a network	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
her playback - based CPM was $ 35 . 60 cents	70 70 70 70 67 67 40 40 40 40 40
And hopefully that traffic will grow over time	40 40 37 37 37 37 37 37
it ' s been a great part - time side hustle	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
agent at some point in your career	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
So weighted by how big they are	76 76 76 67 76 49 79
here like i said lead supporting or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
entertaining or compelling story of your	79 76 53 71 71 71
All right method number five of making passive income	49 49 49 50 54 53 54 53 53
want to do it you can do it but it	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
but i do have some free resources	80 80 80 80 71 80 71
same then this is a great great	67 67 40 40 40 40 40
of expenses related to home ownership	79 79 79 79 79 79
determines your interest rates it	53 53 80 80 80
and still do extremely well on your	41 41 14 50 50 23 50
logos making whatever it is that they	50 50 53 49 52 79 79
help you out as well so now let ' s get	70 70 70 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
activities because everything we do can	49 41 50 50 41 41
can ' t wait for it to come out so i can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
a half by 11 headshot because that is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of how an agent gets paid	77 50 50 50 50 68

the casting director sets the deadline	79 79 79 79 80 80
i booked through my first agency in ohio	67 67 67 64 76 76 76 76
projects however they are still very	49 49 67 67 40 70
just want to say that there ' s definitely	41 41 40 40 40 49 49 49 49
obviously no one watching this actually owns 1 % of Apple	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
attention away from my audition so make	41 40 40 40 49 49 68
this applies to people making minimum	37 40 40 40 40 40

play with the intensity of the light	79 79 79 52 79 79 79
through YouTube which is why I ' m not including this	49 49 79 79 79 76 76 76 67 67 40
and even if you do have some experience	71 68 68 68 71 71 71 71
they don ' t want to get an agent because	50 50 50 50 50 40 40 70 70 43
about the daily highlight at this point	70 67 55 55 58 62 55
the home you can do an appraisal through	70 70 70 70 79 79 70 70
just use your phone	73 73 76 41

Hopefully I ' ll see you in the next video	70 79 79 79 79 79 70 79 79 70
overdramatic what my character doesn	79 79 79 79 79
hours on practice exam questions i ' d say	79 79 61 61 79 79 79 79 52
she ' s done a video where she breaks down	67 67 67 40 40 40 40 40 41 41
very enticing but it takes time and	61 61 62 62 61 62 61
to be more mobile and I want to have	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50
in stocks you could potentially be earning passive income	58 67 67 67 67 67 67 58 58
when they come out i also want to thank	71 71 71 71 71 71 68 68 41

having dialogue and	40 40 49
Now if we look at me and my business	50 49 49 49 49 49 79 68 68
you like decorating with your things or	53 80 80 80 80 71 71

continue pushing towards my goals while	20 20 50 37 50 49
working on right now so earlier this	79 79 79 79 79 70 70

shouldn ' t say I ' ll tell you the answers	41 41 41 76 71 71 71 68 68 68 68
I think both of us have been there where	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 42 42
Obviously if you ' re supporting a family	49 49 49 49 49 49 79 79

and it was for a different product so	40 49 49 49 49 49 41 41
is by relying on brand deals	41 41 41 41 49 49
what money actually is and there ' s a	46 46 46 49 41 41 41 41 41
mistakes that have nothing to do with	77 77 50 49 41 50 50

nothing good ever happens after 2	76 76 76 76 76 79
and may give slightly different advice	71 77 50 50 53 50

point you ' re going to want to create an	71 71 71 71 68 41 41 41 71 79

instagram so we chat a lot about that so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
important what I would do is go for a	71 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

schedule I know you know if you really	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
a four to five - star rating because again	40 49 49 67 67 67 67 77 41
not just talking about college because	79 70 61 70 70 63

that ' s eating into your bottom line every single month	64 64 64 64 67 64 64 55 31 31 28
most actors are not rich and famous and	49 79 49 79 76 49 70 70
is I think a much easier way that anyone	0 0 0 0 53 44 53 26 53
all the basic first steps we went	19 49 67 67 68 40 31
As you may or may not know	37 37 37 49 49 52 52
scale better grow better be more fun	50 41 50 50 19 19 49
goes social media is the really big one	79 79 79 79 52 79 70 70
towards actually just making more money	40 40 31 40 41 41
classes altogether and go straight to a	71 71 40 40 70 40 70
rather than by just kind of regurgitating something at them	76 73 76 76 76 67 70 70 40 40
might be asking	41 71 71
the other actors who don ' t fit the	67 67 67 67 49 49 49 49 71
but these are just like independent	0 0 0 0 0 0
Which is why I love putting my courses on Skillshare	50 50 50 50 49 49 40 49 49 49
one of the best ways that i have seen	40 40 41 41 41 41 41 50 53
knows maybe	49 49
courage requires one but besides that	79 79 79 79 79 79
line though oh and it ' s been an	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
what does this mean for actors and	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
either on my Apple Watch or on my phone or on my Mac	64 64 64 49 49 25 25 25 22 50 46 49 76
and they decided to choose me and that	49 76 79 49 41 41 76 41
but if you are feeling called to make	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
a piece of cake have the cake you know	49 50 50 50 49 49 49 49 49
tempting to go with the fastest one	70 79 79 70 79 79 70

first of all congratulations but don	41 41 41 41 41 41
So 1 % of a million pounds which is 10 , 000 pounds	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this type of style so you ' re gonna have	79 52 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
when i get an audition so if you want to	70 70 70 70 70 71 71 71 71 71
about them	71 71
can see the whole house walk through it	0 0 0 0 0 79 43 43

pittsburgh and they were able to submit	70 68 68 67 71 70 71
it depends on many factors for example	68 41 41 79 49 79 71
and to the costume itself could be a	80 76 76 52 79 79 40 40
if you are interested in voice acting	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
real estate license there are tons of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
well the way that I like to do it is now	70 70 70 70 70 49 40 40 43 50 50
this to happen because their voice is	49 49 76 73 73 73 73
And we as humans we are absolutely terrible	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because that ' s what I wanted to talk	46 46 46 46 46 50 50 50 49

And so if we think about this 9500 pounds of tax	52 70 70 71 71 49 79 80 79 52 49
designing websites and I made this	76 76 76 76 76 76
might get the occasional client from	79 70 70 79 79 79
my career and that is act	71 71 77 80 80 50
but maybe they ' re only looking at union	73 73 73 73 73 73 73 73 73
professional before you get someone to	76 73 73 73 76 76
in 10 years time my 100 pounds will have become 259 pounds	53 53 52 53 26 26 26 26 26 26 53 26
needed something else to happen to her	40 40 40 67 70 67 41
Diaries and many others then I	41 41 80 70 49 41
outside the house in Los Angeles that I	79 79 80 52 52 79 80 80
another thing that really sucks about	49 49 40 40 40 40
you regret not starting like five years	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And it doesn ' t matter	67 67 67 67 67 67

to set metrics as a real estate agent no	79 79 79 79 61 61 61 62 79
This is pretty good	40 40 41 40
down to take that extra time to just	79 79 71 70 61 61 61 34
human being rather than to	50 50 46 46 37
doesn ' t happen every day or even every	49 49 49 49 49 49 70 80 71
your two you ' re beginning mark is your	76 68 68 68 68 64 70 70 52
immediately start acting in a marvel	37 37 37 41 41 41
is a lot harder than keeping it growing	58 40 49 49 49 49 49 40
" These are the boring fundamentals	52 52 70 70 70 25
and it ' s a big decision it shouldn ' t be	68 41 41 41 41 41 79 52 49 49 49 49
it link will be in the description of	79 76 49 49 52 52 76 79
you have representation	71 71 71
agent or anybody else in the industry	40 40 49 49 49 49 49
and remember that relationships are a	50 49 49 49 41 41
acting industry no matter where you live	71 71 79 79 79 71 71
I try and do this weekly	61 61 61 61 61 61
description to the specific page on the	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
through my lines the last thing I do	70 70 40 40 71 70 70 70
google look up your state and then a	40 40 28 28 28 28 28 28
properties you ' re supposed to depreciate	31 31 31 31 31 31 31
have quit	79 52
usually less than 10 percent of the	80 81 54 80 80 80 80
to the people living in your house	80 77 49 43 50 50 54
you may have to join the union before	80 80 80 80 77 67 70 71
you can post those on your website	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
into the film and television industry	71 68 70 79 68 68
doing this you are looking at all the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
getting hit with a huge bill	79 79 70 70 79 70
videos of them acting so that i know	72 71 81 50 50 50 77 71
you ' re gonna realize that taking notes	81 81 81 72 72 72 72 81
can audition	77 79
i definitely recommend talking to your	70 40 40 67 40 31
film programs and if they do have a film	49 49 50 41 41 41 41 41 41
but I ' m gonna give this roughly	71 71 71 71 49 49 49 49
all about acting in atlanta i ' ll put a	79 76 76 73 76 76 76 76 76 80
expectations for example	71 67 43
companies where i ' ve done training	70 50 50 50 50 70 71
build your equity in the home and yeah	19 19 19 20 20 19 20 20
Spending a few hours on a Saturday	52 43 52 52 79 52 79
So any time I have an idea for a video	49 46 49 49 67 67 70 67 67 79
if this is your first time here make	41 41 41 68 68 68 68 65
that i use to prepare for my own test so	41 40 41 41 41 40 41 41 41 40
But in all of the rest of bits of life	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
because you see something like 1000	70 43 43 71 43 70
with someone who ' s taking it too seriously	79 70 70 70 70 70 70 71 49
absolutely do regret when i first	79 79 79 79 79 79
to their shareholders	53 78 81
one - time cost of time or money to make	0 0 0 50 50 76 76 76 76 76
both from a revenue perspective	41 49 40 40 40
and then my hair color	0 0 0 0 0
setting it up you have to spend time you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
year in interest this is easily	80 80 40 79 70 70
in hollywood are all union members	71 71 50 50 80 80
industry so they know that if there ' s an	19 19 49 49 49 46 50 50 50 41
this state	67 68
sense and I know that it ' s it ' s been	47 41 41 41 40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
for you to you know to see what are the	79 80 80 77 76 76 76 76 76 79
however if you ' re getting started you	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
a very small percentage of actors who	80 80 80 80 80 80 80
you ' re not busy at all and it was like	46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 37 49 49
of money from affiliate marketing or you	73 73 73 76 77 77 80
up and don ' t forget to subscribe if you	67 40 40 40 40 49 49 40 67 67
what happens to my money over time by default	44 51 51 53 0 0 0 0 0
And the idea is that when you buy a share	52 49 49 40 49 49 52 52 52 49
you will pass on the first try the	49 40 40 41 40 40 40 40
that many people don ' t think about	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you don ' t have this stuff it ' s going	31 40 40 40 40 40 31 31 31 31 31 40
down below but yeah like i was saying a	79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70 70
self - taping in recent years so	67 67 67 67 67 67 67
not going to take you seriously	79 79 79 79 79 79
wrong choices this yeah Numa works and	33 33 33 33 33 33 33
potentially get a submission of	77 77 77 77 77
into stocks and shares	70 70 70 67
and making good videos is how you grow on YouTube	70 70 70 70 49 52 49 79 79 70
at that point i hadn ' t photographed any	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 77
you know the thing about that is it is	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41
those things we talk a lot about like	73 73 73 73 79 79 79 79
oh I don ' t know what to write	70 79 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
And there is a huge difference	52 52 52 52 52 25
happening in this scene you also get an	40 40 49 49 49 49 79 43
the reason they asked this question is	67 68 67 67 67 67 67
money acting	77 77
the toilets and also the flooring these	70 80 79 80 80 79 79
for a brand that ' s pretty much being a	79 79 76 49 49 49 49 49 49 73
booked the role that girl with the full	79 79 79 79 76 76 76 76
I as the fund manager can say okay the Gringotts fund	41 40 40 79 50 50 50 70 40 31 40
in this video	67 68 68
and the little girl would be sitting on	22 23 50 49 49 49 49 41
And I came across this in a book called	40 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 79
find your projected net operating income	31 31 31 1 31 31
own your instagram followers right	79 79 79 79 76
You get to meet people across the internet	41 41 41 41 41 49 49 49
Your terms are gonna be eight weeks long	72 78 76 76 76 76 76 76
so i want you guys to consider what type	41 41 40 40 49 49 49 40 40
work on any	77 77 71
you can take that percentage of your	28 13 31 31 31 31 31
in a place that is not a tiny little	79 79 79 49 52 79 79 79 79
learning uh how to work with a scene	64 67 64 64 64 64 67 67
you don ' t fit that character description	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you have any questions leave them	49 76 76 73 64 77 71
How I got started creating my businesses from scratch	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
So if you wanna write something off as a business expense	70 70 70 70 70 79 76 79 79 79 79
buying a house here in the United States	79 79 79 79 71 61 62 71
but then the market basically	70 70 49 49 76
you know what we don ' t think you	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 79
don ' t you just do more theater now	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the general public so	49 41 41 41
check out what the opportunities are in	40 40 40 40 67 67 70
set and networking opportunities and all	70 70 40 79 70 70
office deduction most self	31 31 49 76
you guys need to know is how to increase	31 31 31 31 31 32 31 31 40
gonna start to warp and after a few	79 79 76 77 76 79 79 79
that we should even be thinking about	67 67 67 49 49 76 76
Well it ' s not really passive income	52 79 79 79 52 52 52 52
other platforms as well other websites	49 41 68 71 71 71
created a web series called	0 0 0 0 0
Jordan Brown who ' s a casting director	71 80 80 80 80 79 79 80
not show fun or show play the	43 70 70 50 50 80 80
usually the best way of doing that	51 51 51 51 51 54 51
height i think it ' s fine because in the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
over the step - by - step process of buying	40 31 40 40 40 40 40 32 32 31
So basically 50 % of the value has been wiped off	51 51 54 54 50 79 49 49 76 79 80
uniform now I ' m not saying that the	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the final step of not needing anything	41 71 71 79 79 79 79
value or worth to that bookshelf and as	40 40 49 49 49 41 71 44
you can choose to do a roth or a	31 31 28 28 28 31 28 28 31
sources and i ' ll speak about that later	41 40 40 40 40 67 67 67 67
producers future cinematographers	50 50 40
before I started making any money from YouTube AdSense	76 70 70 70 64 59 63 62 62
well the short answer here is there are	71 71 71 71 71 71 50 50
is it television is it commercials or	49 49 67 67 76 49 49
stop thinking about yourself	49 49 49 49
was going to be a part of this	49 49 79 49 49 40 67 40
because it interferes with some aspects of like	68 71 71 71 71 71 80 70
the appreciation on	70 70 71
times more realistic	71 71 71
people they just wait too long until	49 40 68 68 41 41 41
but you can just go for something that	79 79 79 80 79 79 79 79
take my word for it i actually just saw	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
comes in the form of the sacrifices that	67 70 70 70 70 67 67 67
exist well there are certain projects	67 41 40 67 43 70

was better at all of those things than i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

playing in the nba	67 67 67 67
Well firstly to be eligible for monetization	41 41 41 40 43 40 37

your expenses are going to be different	79 79 79 79 79 79 79

on some kind of membership platform like Patreon	58 58 58 58 58 58 67 40
would make a pretty cool addition to	10 40 40 40 40 40 40
and my weekly reviews or whatever	53 51 51 51 51 40
anything there ' s no like actual reason	70 70 70 70 52 52 79 70
mistake of constantly staring at your partner for the entire audition	71 41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71 0 0
agencies are looking for actors with	79 80 80 71 79 79
if you ' ve already started taking acting	52 50 50 50 41 71 71 71
lot of people might be	49 43 41 41 41
it needs to have your stats and some way	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
down and transcribe this whole this	49 49 67 49 40 40
much at all in getting through a real	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
here you would write your character this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you again so many opportunities for	0 0 0 0 0 0
but for now take my word for it that over the long term	76 76 70 70 70 70 71 49 70 70 70 70 70
there ' s also productivity apps	67 67 67 71 71 76

incredible to see just how much your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
my free 10 step audition preparation	80 80 77 80 80 80

and when i worked on that show sean penn	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40
so it is important to find advice from	71 68 41 41 41 50 50 50
it ' s not a quantitative difference	67 67 67 67 70 67 67
more complete way than what it ' s used to	40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49 40 40
eye level you don ' t want your camera	73 73 73 73 73 73 76 76 76
know like reading every word	40 49 40 40 40
can leverage to make money online and in	49 79 50 50 49 49 49 50
and once your channel is growing	41 41 41 41 41 41
can learn CSS in two days and then you	49 49 49 49 49 46 46 46 49
And if you gamified you workplace	76 76 76 41 68 70
And that means that I can just kind of write	49 49 49 49 49 49 70 70 70 70
as a doctor in the NHS the UK ' s National	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
as actors and that they are trying to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but no it happened to me and that ' s the	49 49 44 44 44 44 49 49 49 49 71
is about the question what is enough in	43 43 52 79 49 49 79 21
I ' ve seen plenty of actors do that I do	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 41 41 50 50
los angeles or new york	76 41 41 41 49
thing that i would tell you to have is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to jump to this step	70 79 49 71 41
fact the audience doesn ' t even need to	50 71 71 71 71 71 50 50 41
positive return on your investment let	31 31 31 31 31 31
showing homes to a buyer you could be	31 31 31 40 40 40 40 40
another chances are	79 79 79
works all of this can help you	53 49 49 49 49 49 49
together with your friends and filming	79 49 49 49 49 52
bedroom while debating whether or not to	70 67 67 79 76 67 67
started taking acting classes	79 79 79 79
put down under 20 % the first one is the	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70 70
the thing that we ' re trying to sell them	49 52 25 25 25 25 52 52 79 52
courses whatever the problem is we still	50 77 53 44 53 53 53
without going broke okay step one is	40 43 44 70 43 43 43
each other so you know awesome alright I	49 49 49 49 49 46 46 46
software basically anything you can	41 49 49 49 49
on set one day	71 71 0 0
personal deadline of Thursday at noon	41 41 41 41 41 41
gonna happen and so it was one of those	33 33 33 33 32 33 32 33 33
movies and tv shows this is the way to	71 80 79 53 77 68 53 50 41
and this again happens for a lot of	41 41 70 70 44 41 41 41
because it ' s now made me more happier	67 76 76 76 49 67 49 49 79
If you have more than 4 , 000 pounds a year to invest	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 40 40 49
along with your audition so the name of	71 71 71 67 67 68 71 71
i made those investments did i make them	79 49 81 80 80 80 81 78
sort of life lessons life advice sort of stuff	78 78 78 51 78 77 49 52 79

seconds your knees start shaking your	49 49 49 49 49 49
their recommendations for each role of	70 70 80 80 80 80
available online where yeah you can	40 40 40 40 40 40
instead of a monologue i ' ve talked about	71 80 80 79 77 77 77 80 80
here but this raises and people look at	41 40 40 41 40 40 41 41
guide that i call my audition cheat	68 41 49 52 40 40 44
that you ' ve done those things and you	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 79
because it ' s not it ' s not necessarily	37 37 37 37 46 46 46 46 40 49
anyway get in the habit of always	41 40 40 40 43 40 70
gotten auditions for	70 70 79
projects and say ah I ' ll do it for ten	67 64 64 64 64 64 64 67 71 71 71
because your real estate agent is gonna	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
one of those days i can ' t remember which	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 41
expenses is 30 000	0 0 0 0
" out of this thing	67 67 67 59 59
your personal tax return or i ' ve heard	31 31 31 31 31 40 40 40 40
can make money online and that is by	49 46 19 19 19 49 40 67
about how to get started and how to gain	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
and yeah i want you guys to know that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
other things that you can be doing for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
might get overwhelmed by what was going	79 49 49 79 79 79 79
I ' m married and I live in Omaha	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
casting director	71 71
and offer to be their reader every time	68 71 70 70 70 71 71 71
up booking the role i ' ve also auditioned	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
first name last name - headshot jpg that	14 14 41 41 41 41 41 41
instagram and get a bunch of praise for	79 70 70 70 79 79 79 79
purely for entertainment purposes only	19 19 46 79 79
because you know there	79 79 79 79
does not have enough time to audition	77 76 79 79 71 71 49
looking into myself when it comes to	49 22 19 11 19 19 22
to talk about was specifically for	50 50 49 49 49 49
And here the answer is pretty simple	41 49 49 76 79 79 70
just the rule you can ' t work as a sales	40 31 40 67 64 64 64 64 67 67 67
like this entire backyard was just grass	79 79 79 80 79 79 80
couple more lines right here by just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the sacrifices are not going to be worth	41 40 40 40 49 49 79 79
into the trap of	41 41 41 41
and if they see that you ' ve been doing	70 80 80 81 81 81 81 81 80 79
mentioned and then you look at okay so	49 40 49 40 40 49 49 49
to join the union	67 67 67 70
And then you would own shares in Apple	58 58 31 31 58 58 58 58
is to provide value in a way	61 61 70 49 79 79 80
then there ' s only so much hacking that you can do	80 71 71 71 71 71 71 80 80 71 71 71
and these are the tips tricks and study	23 23 41 41 41 41 41 40
he ' s this former Navy SEAL or is it more	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and now you have someone else that can	80 79 79 79 79 70 70 70
probably have a better shot than some of	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67
found this video	41 71 71
so so yeah start young and set yourself	40 40 79 52 49 49 43 41
you live it may cost a little bit less	67 68 71 71 71 71 71 71 68
there is	11 11
so let ' s first talk about what you	70 71 71 71 71 71 71 70 70
the productions are happening my	71 71 77 41 71
experience so that we can	71 68 67 67 67
so why 20 % why is that the magic number	49 49 79 79 79 79 79 71 41 79
better the triplex has twice as many	79 79 70 70 79 79 70
back to the casting director and say hey	37 31 40 40 41 50 50 49
download it for free	44 44 53 26
to acting opportunities I was extremely	71 71 70 79 41 79
being cast in that type of role so when	67 67 67 71 71 41 71 71 40
you are momentarily distracted as you look over briefly	41 41 41 41 41 41 50 50 14
important to hear those different	41 41 50 51 51
why it ' s 20 % they were just like hey 20 %	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
down below self taping commandment	79 70 70 22 1
for is a 740 or above	40 40 67 71 71 71
and you ' ll find that once you get	71 70 70 70 40 40 40 40 61
and give it a like alright moving on the	72 71 71 70 70 79 49 41 71
finite number of ways that they can ask	49 49 40 40 40 40 40 22
people however when you learn about how	49 41 49 49 40 49 49
i ' m still working on that project that i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
is one option a second option for acting	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50

into the film and television industry my	41 71 71 71 71 71 68
carpets are a pain in the ass to clean	79 79 79 76 80 80 76 79 79
now before we get into what happened	50 49 49 76 76 49 49
can get the lowest rate possible it	40 40 31 31 31 31 58
relaxed on set and be able to get into	53 52 76 77 80 80 76 79 79

taking photos of stuff	79 79 79 80

I wouldn ' t say it ' s easy to make $ 100 a month	41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
I could lose all of it	70 52 52 25 25 43

so much effort to get started initially	67 64 64 64 64 67 67
and to make sure that the sets that they	50 50 50 50 50 41 53 80 80

yeah that ' s probably the best thing	40 40 40 40 70 70 70 70
intense all the time sometimes just kind	49 49 41 41 40 40 40
over the last like two years of being on Skillshare	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
i was ready to open up my own credit	31 31 40 40 40 40 40 40 41
it out gone are the days when you have	79 79 79 73 73 71 79 79 79
good chunk of money number two is to	79 79 79 79 79 80 79 79
spending what you ' re able to afford	70 61 70 70 70 70 70 70
like 100 bucks normally but they have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
project hopefully you ' ve got some	71 68 71 71 71 80 80
expensive well that	80 80 41
few credits	71 71
bones more than I have so not gonna work	32 41 32 31 40 40 49 49 49
an escort now when you ' re doing work as	31 31 31 31 40 40 40 40 40 40
um then pretty soon in the future that	79 70 79 79 79 79 79 79
more money with increased levels of	0 0 0 1 21 21
can you stand out from the crowd	80 41 41 41 71 71 71
for Friday at noon I give myself a	76 79 79 79 41 41 41 41
and you chip away at what doesn ' t work	6 6 6 6 6 29 29 29 29 29
hundreds of homes before they actually	44 44 44 41 43 41
So pretty much anytime I come across any	54 80 52 76 79 76 79 49
i ' ve talked about this before how	76 76 76 76 77 80 80 80
offers you representation before anybody	67 67 64 64 64
a link to it down in the description	77 41 41 71 71 71 71 71
To get started we ' re gonna give this	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
actor while they ' re trying to get all	40 49 50 50 50 49 49 40 76
into managing the assets as well	50 23 50 80 50 67
we ' re gonna give maintenance	49 49 49 50 50 50
background work does not go on an acting	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
which takes it down to 24	58 61 61 31 61 31
sales and letting your people know about	80 52 79 79 79 79 79
criminal negligence if she starts trying	79 79 79 79 79 79
there ' s so much to learn and this is a	41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40 40 40 41
qualified to be doing this	79 79 79 79 79
that ' s very difficult i know of	70 70 70 79 79 79 79 80
forward because just because you didn	71 76 64 64 64 64
people will buy your paid stuff but only	53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53
get an offer accepted and	31 31 31 31 31
and that you ' re letting affect the way	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
agent and you don ' t have other people	70 71 68 41 41 41 50 53 80
i had those traits a little bit more	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
which is well how do we actually make money	67 70 70 67 67 67 67 67 67
you ' re paying that fifteen point three	40 40 40 41 40 31 31 31
speaking by themselves and there is no	49 49 40 40 40 41 41
percent higher as your credit score gets	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
right the fifth step	31 35 31 40
pressing to push play and pause every	43 43 43 52 52 43 43
and you are ready to go into your	64 67 64 67 70 70 79 52
on scenes together that ' s such an	41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49
that book is now on bookshelves	76 67 67 67 58 58
this place is like upwork and fiber that	26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26
wanted to simplify it because	43 43 71 70 41
towards your own career	76 76 76 76
if you want to be a working graphic	40 49 49 80 71 71 71 71
a conversation with him	71 71 71 49
and really helpful articles that will	1 1 10 1 43 43
so i encourage you to sit in on class	76 76 77 77 80 77 77 77 80
what do you mean no not doing it I	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actors can make money within this	71 71 71 40 70 70
beneficial when you use it in the right	79 79 79 79 79 79 71 49
would just put	0 0 0
them and says hey i ' m brand new i don	70 70 70 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
is horizontal many of you will want to	0 0 0 80 80 68 68 68
about today are firstly drop shipping	0 0 46 19 19 37
change it to something that ' s just	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
So just appreciating this and having this kind of	58 58 58 70 61 61 61 58 58
And so as a lesson to all of us	49 49 49 79 79 70 79 52 52
You need to have quite a large amount of money	67 67 70 67 70 70 70 70 70 70
work their way up right so in your	67 64 64 41 49 71 41 41
have to have some type of balance to	71 71 70 70 71 71 71 71
almost all of them	79 79 79 79
acting let ' s face it we aren ' t studying	71 79 79 79 79 79 79 40 40 40 41
you can get them to laugh and break up	49 49 41 71 71 71 71 49 49
So for example they might say that	80 80 80 68 41 41 41
learn school stuff one of their newer	79 79 79 52 52 79 70
about talent agents	52 76 41
as well as i ' m currently in a mastermind	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
in this industry that a lot of people	44 50 50 50 80 53 53 53
and you feel super proud	37 37 64 67 67
So firstly because that 50 , 000 pounds is profit	79 52 52 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
taking it to a whole new level	79 49 49 79 79 79 79
because I can ' t get that 20 % right like	70 70 70 70 70 79 79 70 70 79 79
be paying on the lower end of that	61 61 61 70 71 68 71 71
you can bounce ideas off of so	31 40 31 31 31 32 40
to your resume now i ' m going to put this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
checking my availability i was actually	79 79 79 61 61 79
getting an agent right away is going to	76 79 76 76 73 76 76 76
the project to the producers so that is	80 80 80 80 80 49 40 40
the acting career center here to help	71 71 71 71 71 68 68
super valuable this is going to help you	71 79 79 79 70 70 61 79
you don ' t want to be uploading a	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
It ' s actually quite a good one to keep asking yourself	50 50 50 49 49 49 49 50 50 50 50 77
to going online and doing virtual	79 49 49 49 49 49
helps if you ' re trying to sell any kind	79 52 25 25 25 52 52 52 52 49
from two to four dollars I think is a	79 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
This begs the question how hard is it	63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
if you ' ve graduated from school already	49 49 49 49 49 41 71 71
in the beginning of the process because	76 76 76 76 76 76 76
times like 45 minutes with explanation	20 20 20 20 20 20
when the project is shooting the rate of	40 40 70 67 76 67 70 70
time lose momentum and they take a long	79 79 79 79 79 52 52 43
and he ' s got a team around it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
correct industry term is audition sides	43 71 71 76 67 67

Don ' t feel like you have to email the university to ask them	70 70 70 71 71 70 79 79 79 79 79 76 79 79
and for good reason it ' s the most	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
comment below - I ' d love to hear about	71 71 71 70 70 70 70 70 80 71
third if you are	71 71 71 71
actors to post their headshots and	77 79 79 79 79 79
And the answer is that an investment	80 50 50 22 49 49 49
might not be but just understand what	71 70 68 71 68 71 71
point that we ' re not really making a	76 76 70 70 70 70 49 46 49
actors lifestyle that ' s not always the	40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
then we ' ll talk about how to join	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70

can help you fill out those forms	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
smell the roses on the journey	79 79 79 79 79 79
doing without a talent agent	80 79 79 79 79
vehicle deduction there ' s the mileage	31 31 0 0 0 0 0
let ' s talk about actors first	41 41 41 41 71 71 71
specific type of business because i	41 44 71 71 71 49
have that	44 44
But the problem is that	67 58 31 31 31
audition if you have an audition for a	71 71 71 79 79 79 79 70
and then kind of dropping down to three pounds	41 41 41 40 40 40 38 37 41
this is how i ' ve been doing my grocery	40 43 43 70 70 70 70 70 79 79
an acting career is training it ' s not	71 71 71 80 79 79 79 79 80
That audience knows likes and trusts you	58 58 58 58 58 58 58
but there was and I think this is more	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
being paid like 50 bucks or 100 bucks to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and there ' s always been this the stigma	50 50 50 50 49 49 49 49 37
along to the actor	67 67 67 50
ago I was in London for work alright I	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
a big - time hollywood celebrity you	68 70 70 70 70 70 68
school plays like these types of things	50 49 49 40 40 41 41
i . e outperform the index	70 70 70 61 61 49
that file name they know exactly who it	67 67 67 67 67 67 68 68
there are a ton of real estate agents	40 40 40 40 67 76 76 76
licensed professional that can help	67 31 67 67 40
shows whether it ' s an in - person audition	70 50 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 71

second of all if you ' re interested in	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 43 43
every single week today we are talking	79 41 41 41 49 49 49
step number 11 is to branch out to a	1 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 20
selling info products so buy info	67 67 67 67 49 22
I wanna do all this kind of stuff	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

why it ' s so important to get your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
agents you will 100 need to do it	79 70 79 79 79 79 79 79
getting my first few lessons and acting	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
for instance when i joined sag	68 71 71 71 71 71
have to refill it right now another way	71 71 71 71 40 40 40 70

that your real estate license is a great	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of Netflix or to play " War Zone " with the boys	52 52 53 80 53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53
the character that you ' re auditioning	71 71 41 71 71 71 71
But if we average out the last 30 to 50 years	58 58 58 58 58 59 58 55 55 55 55
once you do get representation now	49 49 49 79 70 79
to around 24 , 000 pounds	44 44 53 53 53 53
estate agent and starting to look at	32 43 53 53 80 80 40

and I called it Gringotts and let ' s say a hundred people	71 71 40 31 61 61 76 76 76 71 71 70 76
also think that the only way you can put	40 40 40 41 41 41 40 40 40
every single time I might do one and if	67 70 68 68 40 40 40 40 40

and building a team of people around me	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because each state is going to have	70 79 79 79 79 79 79
before we go there we need to talk about	1 1 1 1 1 49 46 46 46

investing in yourself invest in a Skillshare subscription	1 19 19 19 19 10 10 10

servicemembers and there	79 79 79
and the cash on cash return right here	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

like with anything maintenance is a little bit easier	0 21 21 21 49 49 49 49 40

investment properties and multi	53 52 40 40
and make sure it ' s photo paper this is	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 73 46 40
plenty of actors that have done that and	68 68 44 53 50 50 77 77
not completely	0 0
and I recognised this	71 71 71 71
is when you rent out part of your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
he decided that in one of the scenes the	41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40 40
and so if you put in $ 7 , 500 in the S & amp ; P 500	40 40 40 40 40 31 31 31 31 31 40 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and decide that they don ' t want to hire	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that involves analyzing data from like 2000 patient records	68 67 67 67 67 68 68 67 67
they focused and on in character	46 41 41 41 44 41
paying that extra price for that trendy	79 79 79 70 79 70 79
resume looked like this when i first	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
needs to be able to fit in this story	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
to mention my own website	80 80 80 76 76
this means you ' re taking a 20 000 loss	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that as much as 80 percent of new agents	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
years ago I was in London for work what	49 49 49 49 49 49 76 77 78
dogs with inner life of ryan your	71 49 49 49 41 79 79
keep 90 . if you make a thousand dollars	49 49 49 41 41 40 40 40 40
near atlanta have the best	41 40 40 70 70
i think it really helped me in terms of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
they don ' t become more resilient well	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
thousand dollars in the bank	70 70 61 61 61
another really important thing that we	79 79 79 79 79 76
other role in this project that you	76 76 76 76 76 76 76
classf get perfect headshot is not just be	71 49 49 49 49 79 79 76
I check my portfolio once every six months	43 76 70 70 76 76 71 71
so in the summer of 2015 we built an	49 49 49 49 49 50 51 50 43
year i can ' t remember but recently i	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
get a dog okay so in an audition like	79 79 79 79 41 41 41 41 41
single tuesday at noon eastern standard	76 70 79 79 79 79
recommend most people do you ' ll have a	31 31 31 40 49 49 49 49 40
or a 15 or a 20 commission we won ' t get	77 68 68 68 68 41 41 40 40 40 40 40
you ' re trying to figure out when you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because it suddenly becomes scalable	22 49 49 49 71
the mental toughness to handle this	79 79 79 79 79 79
of bringing in enough income to cover	52 52 52 79 79 80 79
that you are selling other people ' s products	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
that decision after the fact okay so	34 70 70 70 70 52 79
was eating how I was eating and it took	50 50 49 49 41 50 41 50 46
So this is the lifetime revenue of my YouTube channel	79 79 44 53 53 53 53 53 53 44
referring to movies when they say take 1	67 67 67 67 70 67 67 67
your brand like all of those things are	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
a lot of money with these types	43 44 44 43 41 41 44
house is the potential resale value in	79 79 79 79 79 79 80
in order to work with an agent so i hope	50 50 50 41 41 41 44 53 49 49
that is going to impact so many people	70 70 43 40 79 79 79 79
really nice and they ' re luxurious but	49 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and you saw all those movies and	76 76 71 41 41 41 49
straight to the government as	40 31 31 67 67
that a great audition doesn ' t guarantee	41 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that fifteen point three percent tax	43 70 40 43 70 31
that come with that but not only that at	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the daily challenges feature on Brilliant	37 37 40 40 37 37
every single one of the 12 steps is	41 41 41 68 68 71 71 41
if i had let that stop me i wouldn	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 79
bit if you had any confusion about how	43 43 43 70 70 71 71 71
those things okay so in this video we	50 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
rehearsing the scene so you ' re gonna	67 73 73 76 67 67 67 67
this idea has actually changed the game for me	80 49 52 49 52 49 49 49 49
effectively because think about it if	70 49 41 41 41 41
owe a lot to house hacking here are the	49 49 79 49 49 71 76 76 73
guys ways to become financially	70 70 79 70 79
gonna be able to sell later on and	0 0 0 0 0 0 79 79
mind that you ' re gonna need money to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you virtually yeah it ' s good to see you	50 50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50
single week now it ' s actually been more	71 71 71 50 50 50 50 50 41
my real money in 2012	67 67 70 49 70
people better actors and i should have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in and i made probably six or seven	49 49 41 71 71 71 71 68
of people you absolutely do not need the	70 70 40 79 79 79 70 43
Other things around this is working with music	43 62 62 19 19 19 19 19
exhausting day and you feel like having	50 50 50 50 50 50 49
for many other projects uh when i	67 64 64 64 80 80 80
interested in let ' s get started right	79 79 76 76 76 67 64 40
they ' ve done plays since they were in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
recommend that you do your own research	44 53 71 71 80 80 53
And the way that our memory works is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
my auditions then i ' ve actually created	40 40 50 41 41 41 41 41
such as vons or ralph ' s that ' s where you	49 79 52 79 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26
who are very kindly sponsoring this video	50 50 44 53 80 80 53
shouldn ' t have been caught off guard and	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77
aren ' t necessary now of course you do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70
mailing list of 20 , 000 people and now	49 40 40 40 40 40 71 53 53
spend those x dollars you ' re going to	4 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
particularly useful either recently or	46 46 46 46 46
percentage I ' m doing really well with	71 41 41 41 41 41 71 71
that are used all the time	49 79 79 80 80 50
little bit about me and about my dog	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
dollar pie now one very important part	71 71 67 71 71 71 71
it makes it so that it ' s the only thing	49 40 44 40 40 40 40 40 41 41 41
background this stuff back here is cool	0 0 19 19 19 19 19
understand that your acting ability	76 76 76 79 76
happens all the time	79 76 76 76
television shows	71 71
got a call back for that	41 71 71 41 71 41
now definitely for some industries this	49 49 43 70 40 40
estate agent the next really important	79 79 79 79 79 79
to submit you to casting directors so	71 71 71 71 71 71 71

In this video we ' re gonna talk about	58 58 58 31 31 31 41 41 50
will make real estate investing a much	31 31 31 31 31 31 31
loans is be lower your credit score the	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
lot of time going through the course and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
really ensure that you have the	79 79 79 79 79 79
private acting teachers private acting	49 41 41 40 40
a lot of especially the people that are	41 49 49 49 49 41 71 71
found it informative please give it a	79 79 71 79 79 79 79
audition for one character and they use	79 79 79 52 79 79 79
the city you live in right now even if	79 79 79 79 79 71 71 71 70
so don ' t submit for projects in toronto	71 71 71 71 72 81 81 77 76
my first audition for the commercial on	79 79 79 79 79 76 40
the description below so make sure to	80 80 80 80 76 50 41
many of them have	41 41 41 50
so that	0 0
come from the on - camera world	50 49 40 40 40 40 49
another way that actors make money in	76 67 41 41 41 41 71
at 1 p	40 40 41
all right second bedroom right here	52 43 43 43 43 0
and then you can sell your services	53 53 53 53 49 50 50
but you might not like the way I coach	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and just write a quick note for that	79 73 76 76 76 52 49 49
world to push us along	49 49 49 76 49
and starting to	41 41 41
So it provided those two conditions are met	70 70 70 70 70 67 70 71
well they ' re going to need that actor to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
who has been trained to express the	31 31 20 20 20 20 20
hassle and they actually just go with an	40 40 31 31 31 40 40 41
of how much money you as the creator	40 40 61 61 67 67 68 71
camera even in an unscripted situation	79 79 79 79 79 79
passing rates but I ' ve heard that for	79 70 70 52 52 52 79 79 70
and then you sold when it was $	79 71 71 67 67 67 31 28
a lot more to actually just put stuff down on paper	52 52 52 43 49 49 49 49 49 79 79
the movies and television shows that	53 53 53 79 80 71
the acting career center here to help	71 71 71 71 71 71 68
invest in real estate well it ' s to build	49 79 79 79 52 52 52 52 52 52
uh key ratios that you guys need to look	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
into the film and television industry	72 72 72 72 72 72
But secondly your holidays are really long	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
than paying for	70 79 79
them to see that sometimes you ' re gonna	41 41 41 41 41 70 70 70 70
so many new things about all of these	49 79 79 79 49 79 80 79
someone like a surgeon that you ' re working with	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
let me say that i am not a theater actor	49 49 49 76 76 76 67 67 67 67
drenched in sweat completely soaked	49 46 46 49 49
if i had let that client stop me from	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
have to be training towards a specific	40 40 37 37 10 10 37
television shows then I ' ve created a	71 71 68 67 67 67 67 71
i mentioned earlier that yes you are	71 71 71 67 70 70 67
returns for the last two years	31 31 31 31 31 31
But I thought I ' d do this annual roundup	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 25 52 52
graph because if it took you 30 years to	32 32 32 32 32 32 41 32 41
nothing scripted so i recorded my	49 49 70 49 49 71
and cast yourself as the main character	41 71 71 41 41 41 52
Another piece of advice that I forgot to give is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80 79 79
i think atlanta is the best market	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
and the lower your credit score the	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
availability conflicts refer to the	70 67 70 70 70
for some amazing projects so	79 79 79 79 79
who understands the industry who has	80 80 80 80 80 80
i ' ve created a free audition	71 71 71 41 41 41 41
and having made 77 videos already	32 32 32 32 33 33
face especially in your eyes but I will	74 74 74 74 74 74 76 76
time and after the auditions were done	71 71 50 50 80 80 80
really taught me that we don ' t need to	21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21
To use me as an example so me and my brother have a podcast	52 52 52 43 43 43 52 52 52 52 52 52 79 52
especially when you factor in the time	43 70 40 40 70 70 70
Okay so that begs the question	31 31 31 31 55 55
want to know why they asked you this	68 68 71 71 71 71 71 71
can replace it or add to it add to your	67 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
until next time keep practicing keep	80 80 52 52 49 52
hundreds of auditions that I ' ve done the	80 44 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
kind of prepared for the scene	79 79 79 79 79 79
now right off the bat you can see that	20 20 20 20 11 11 11 11 11
that ' s not working I ' ll try another if	40 40 40 67 40 49 49 49 49 52 52
weird situation and let ' s bring it back	49 71 71 50 50 50 40 31 40
just sold we were on the market for like	0 0 1 1 -59 1 1 0 0
baton and i we were all locked in said	79 79 79 79 79 76 76 76 76
payments the higher the LTV the higher	71 71 71 71 71 70 61
you take are of great addition to great	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
If you told me a couple of years ago	22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22
college students this is a really great	79 79 79 79 79 79 70
and energized ready for a great evening	80 33 51 51 42 42 42
instant equity by buying certain	32 31 31 31 31
like how does it work (	79 22 49 22 52 52
brought up the cost of 48	0 0 0 0 0 0
every single day of the week and if	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
And finally if you look historically	49 49 67 79 76 70
If you ' d asked me two and a half years ago	64 70 70 70 70 71 67 67 67 67 64 64
sidenote the actress who played the	77 77 77 77 77 77

want to help you	49 49 41 41
any money but you ' re getting experience	80 80 77 71 71 71 71 71

And as we always talk about on this channel	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50
recommended so many of my friends to use	40 40 40 31 31 40 40 40
then you ' re going to have to find out	41 41 41 41 44 71 71 71 71 71
footage for all of us to put on our demo	68 50 77 49 49 79 79 52 49 52
part with their hard - earned cash to buy	53 53 52 44 44 44 49 49 49
you ' re gonna start a YouTube channel	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41

actually have to pay for it you have to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
about that your agent had your back	41 41 41 41 41 41 50
you will pass the test your first try	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
overtime we have compounding	49 49 40 40
be spent just marketing yourself so	79 79 79 79 79 79
get to set your own hours you don ' t need	40 40 67 40 31 31 31 31 31 31 40
make in their lifetime so a lot is	40 76 76 76 67 67 67 67
basically what you want whether it ' s a	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 50
But the thing that I recommend	41 13 13 22 49 22
either as a one - off or more likely these days	70 70 70 70 70 70 67 67 67 49 41
and around our jobs	0 1 0 19
and they ' re going to call you up and	76 76 76 76 76 76 80 71 71 41
these three go	71 71 71
and in order to represent an actor i	40 40 70 70 70 70 70 70
them in this video	71 71 71 71
Be okay with organizing an event	41 41 41 41 41 41
where you look directly into the camera	41 41 41 41 77 77 77
and if you can do that if you can get	47 46 46 46 46 0 0 0 0 0
the production side but i ' m not i ' m not	71 41 40 40 40 40 40 49 40 40 40 40
in this industry casting directors	41 41 40 40 40
and this doesn ' t happen in every scene	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in that time what is it today	40 70 70 70 70 67 31
that those can be great ways to start	41 49 49 41 41 41 41 41
want to get a sense of your personality	71 41 50 49 50 41 41 71
So for example if I were to put a hundred pounds	79 79 70 79 79 79 79 52 52 52 52
that will really help the podcast grow	49 67 76 77 77 76 76
job where you know not every day is the	31 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
within this industry is a really popular	80 79 52 79 79 79 71
number one on my list why because we	41 41 41 41 41 41 44 41
that so for instance	80 50 50 50
auditions with your phone	67 67 67 68
of that file and make sure you don	76 76 76 76 76 79 79 79
average American just doesn ' t have	70 70 70 70 70 70 79
It made me realize that we ' re always	73 73 73 77 77 76 76 76 70
this is how i ' ve been taking acting	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
description below to see something like	53 53 26 53 44 71
have many many scenes that you ' re trying	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
person ' s license you need to find a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79
or taking a job that pays less but that	1 1 1 1 20 20 31 1 2
because that would make you an extremely rich person	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then Brexit happens the next day	1 0 0 0 0 0 0

training is the first thing you should	71 71 71 71 71 71 79
vanities for like 80 bucks and they	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
know that with having a great brand has	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
At that point absolutely everyone	76 79 70 79 79

my clients are really appreciate you	41 41 46 46 50 49
with 1 . 4 million views	50 40 40 40 61 61
never auditioning for just that one role	41 41 41 41 41 41 40
And so when we give our money to a company	58 61 58 58 58 58 58 61 61 61
every few months just to make sure you ' re still	77 50 50 49 67 76 77 79 79 79 79
are going to print all right we are so	71 71 80 80 79 79 79 79 79
And the idea is that you should have a list	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
Secondly index funds give you	49 79 71 71 71
dramatically the next bad money habit	79 79 79 70 79 79
when you buy an	11 11 19 11
different skill set but	70 70 67 67
as well as my loan license exams was to	76 76 76 79 79 80 79 79 79
when you audition for something you	41 41 41 41 41 41
fitness and health as well yeah yeah so	49 49 40 49 49 49 49 49
warranty date and the truth is that	79 70 43 70 70 70 80
then the night before	76 76 68 71
Sport And Prove Your Love Me This Way	19 19 19 80 80 80 50 79
and two hundred thousand dollars	0 0 0 0 0
could look like that you ' re trying too	76 79 79 80 80 80 80 79 79
to work on scene work rather than	40 40 40 43 43 41 41
then I gained 45 pounds just and it was	49 19 38 19 19 19 19 19 19
keep your file sizes small remember that	0 0 0 0 0 49 49
energy in alignment with my values and	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
from memorization because you gotta know	33 32 32 32 32 32
through their commercials so more MORE they ' re hiring actors who looked like	41 40 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 40 40
like that	50 40
there I think it was the first ad who	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 68 68
certain way of asking questions it ' s not	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 22
that helps you crop your headshots to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
as their fee now if you ' re doing it	40 31 31 31 31 28 28 28 31 31
other side of the camera	41 41 40 41 41
Really curve into your heart the serenity prayer	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
every single actor that wants to	76 76 49 79 79 79
after working your second union job	68 67 67 77 68 68
it really does not matter we are faced	79 79 79 70 79 79 79 79
on how you can start side hustles in your spare time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 19 11
instagram reels because that ' s what ' s	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
money we must take time to dress for our	0 51 51 20 21 25 50 51 48
that role and then it was like you know	46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46
i head straight to the sales section if	40 61 61 61 70 70 70 70
and then when the production schedule	80 80 80 80 80 80
now don ' t worry if your demo reel is	52 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 71 71
And because she ' s just launched season two of her podcasts	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76 79 79
on it anyways with selling a house of	43 52 43 79 79 79 80 79
to enjoy more of the things that we ' re doing	41 41 50 50 50 50 77 79 79 79 79
fit for instance I know I look nothing like Brad Pitt	41 41 49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
from me and so if you can build up that	79 71 71 71 76 40 40 40 40 49
if janet starts throwing around reckless	79 79 79 79 79 79
valuable then people will buy it and	70 49 49 73 73 76 80
are used in your location if you ' re in a	71 71 71 71 71 79 49 49 49 49 49
get clients and this is really the most	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
It ' s a very much like an sort of slow and steady	41 41 41 13 41 41 32 32 41 32 32 32 32
when it comes to auditions props are no	70 79 79 79 79 49 49 49

wife and they ' re repainting their	67 67 67 67 67 70 70
because I was like I can ' t believe	32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
and we just banged out these this work over the space	0 0 51 51 48 48 51 51 51 0 51
companies can charge as much as 30	79 70 40 70 79 79 79
20 % if you ' re waiting on a home purchase	70 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 71
mail out your application to the	40 40 31 31 40 40
if you want to pursue	68 68 68 60 60
And the other nice thing about Skillshare is that it ' s like	50 50 50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
because they were born with it	41 41 49 49 52 52
about yourself question let ' s talk about	49 71 71 68 68 68 71 71
whether we ' re buying this thing because	73 73 73 73 73 73 76 81
It doesn ' t matter how young you are	49 43 43 43 34 34 61 62 40
so again we ' re going to bold this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
start with drop shipping the basic idea	53 53 53 26 53 23 19
so that ' s my story about how i got my	49 49 49 49 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
very easy	40 40
like Amazon Associates	68 41 41
can ' t see yourself doing anything else	40 40 40 40 40 43 79 79
statistics aren ' t too clear on like the	76 70 70 70 79 79 79 79 79
before 60 , 000 subscribers	49 49 49 49 49
with you in some way shape or form	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
look for the produce that is on sale	70 70 40 76 79 70 70 70
now but I ' ll record all of the opposite	67 67 67 67 67 40 40 40 40 41
the ways to join are	67 68 41 41 71
looking at one week I got bad news for	41 38 38 38 47 14 10 10 10
but genuinely Skillshare is a great place to teach stuff	49 41 41 46 50 40 10 40 37 46
will give you the tools to succeed and	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
And caveat number three is that	70 70 70 70 71 71
is that you should not invest in individual stocks	31 58 58 61 61 61 52 52 52
investment like i got x number of	79 79 80 51 54 54 45
it ' s probably gonna cost like a maybe	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
the actor that ' s auditioning stands in front of the camera	49 52 71 71 71 71 71 49 71 71 71 71
rates are super low right now when	40 40 40 67 67 67 67
whereby you now only need it to be eight minutes long	67 67 68 68 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
different and then they wanted the	79 79 79 79 79 79
they start investing and letting their	41 49 40 40 40 49
money on	70 79
study for your exams and again those	0 1 1 0 0 11 0
that actors make money within this	70 76 70 70 70 70
if you were in a short film you would	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you ' re in a high cost of living area	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
because it ' s 10 % of then the 110	52 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
and you are a sag - aftra member now	64 64 64 64 71 71 71 49 49
them now the goal here isn ' t to follow	76 77 80 80 80 76 76 76 76 79
advantage to not dressing in full	79 77 79 79 79 79
is the industry standard size for a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
helping out with a casting session one	41 41 41 71 71 71 71
problems with that one	71 67 40 70
invested in stocks	31 31 31
" There ' s a disconnect between the future	61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61
practice practice practice your	41 71 71 71
a script but they told me this is a	68 67 77 50 40 40 40 40 40
this thing open up these and voila so	79 79 0 0 0 0 0 0
point once you ' ve built up 20 % equity in	70 79 79 79 79 43 70 70 70 79 70
all the stuff you can write this off in	31 31 31 40 40 40 40 40 31
pass that as well so the first step is	0 0 0 0 0 70 40 70 70
actually make your mortgage payments if	40 31 31 31 31 31
necessarily as much there ' s less	71 70 61 70 70 70 40
For example let ' s say you buy a house	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 1 31
says and interviews that actually he	52 26 26 26 26 26
actors at the moment or just female	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
can also lead to increased	70 43 43 70 70
your acting	71 71
for my youtube video	49 41 41 41
And generally doing well in affiliate marketing	49 49 49 50 41 49 49
just because loads of people around the world	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and the cool thing about YouTube	52 52 49 49 52 49
through real estate express they	79 79 79 0 0
in to the film and television industry	41 41 71 71 71 71 71
our own products if we ' re selling our	40 40 76 67 40 40 40 28 28
the seventh and final memorization	41 41 41 41 71
And the first 200 people to use that link	40 40 31 67 70 67 67 70 68
is not gonna be worth a thousand pounds anymore	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
be performing that scene twice blocking	68 71 71 71 71 70
I ' m just gonna do it consistently	70 70 70 52 52 52 52 52
because while there are many cities that	40 1 1 28 31 31 31
and not your mouth and speak today gonna	41 41 41 41 41 50 50 50
other things in order for the agent to	40 40 40 40 41 50 53 53
you ' re getting a credit for your resume	77 77 77 71 71 71 71 71 50
And so you make an account on an online broker	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 67 64 67
knowledge and uncertainty and that looks	0 0 0 0 0 0
out the others so	79 79 79 79
and I hope to see you on set one day	40 40 67 67 67 67 67 67 0 0
questions then are you know because as	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and knew what they were doing the scene	79 79 79 79 79 79 80 79
you think about you	52 79 79 79
99 of the work that was available for	50 80 80 80 80 80 80 50
Like firstly you have no high interest credit card debt	70 70 70 76 79 40 40 49 70 70
I was sort of sitting on the sofa behind there	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
rather than the fact that maybe you got an extra 0	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
laughing and joking with each other in	50 50 50 41 68 41 41
if you ' re doing it just more for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and the first 200 people to click that link	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
with and I ' ll record for instance line	70 67 40 40 40 49 67 40 41
they ' ll charge between five to ten	40 40 40 41 41 32 32 31
you ' re trying to buy a type of meat	52 52 52 52 79 52 52 79 79 70
the art of trying to monetize something will itself	80 80 80 79 76 43 67 67 49
for less than you actually bought it	70 77 49 70 70 70 70
much you can realistically charge	79 79 79 79 79
you are never forced to join the union	71 71 71 71 70 70 70 71
quite a bit	79 79 79
in my career too so those are a couple	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
top doing things that everyone else is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you like this video please give it a	49 52 53 80 53 41 41 41 41
even if you don ' t book that particular	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and you know then I just became more	38 46 37 37 50 46 46 46
check them out i will put a link to them	79 79 52 52 79 79 79 79 52 52
potentially for	67 67
and it was cut out with scissors would	77 77 77 77 76 76 76 79
to watch the video so they go away from it	67 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 67 64
riding on your knowledge and expertise	67 67 70 70 70 67
that our money is still worth 206 pounds in 10 years time	26 17 34 34 44 44 53 80 80 53 53 53
and start looking for auditions on those	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
taken many many write - offs and used many	40 40 40 70 70 70 43 40 40
is demo reel editing now when you first	70 70 68 68 71 71 70 70
whenever your pay is based on commission	79 79 79 79 70 70 70
telling me that you saw me	41 41 41 71 71 71
That also really helps support the channel	67 67 67 67 67 70 70
the correct size paper if we don ' t our	79 52 44 41 41 49 52 52 52 49
without worrying about the quality	40 70 70 50 49
that helped me enjoy the journey a little bit more	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to build a website and make money off	31 31 31 31 31 40 67 40
if it ' s a restaurant scene like we talked about before take a moment to really	79 79 79 79 68 71 40 40 40 41 41 40 71 41 41 41 41
you can and if you really want to do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
If you like this video and you wanna get started	79 22 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
helping out a producer or a director	49 43 49 49 49 49 49
bunch of sites like hotpads and trulia	58 58 58 58 31 31 40
scene only has to be maybe 30 seconds to	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
going to give you a hard time so	40 40 40 41 79 40 49 49
In fact I was recently interviewed on an episode	46 46 49 46 49 49 49 49 49
it comes to their headshots but today	41 41 41 41 80 77 77
but don ' t just give me a thumbs down	68 68 68 68 68 38 37 37 37 68
biggest things with house hacking is	79 52 52 79 79 79
bedroom with a desk or it could be a	0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
well that ' s the number that lenders use	79 70 70 70 70 71 71 71 70
but then it ' s sort of fun in hindsight	49 50 50 50 50 71 40 31 67 67
education business i have now	79 79 79 79 79
a labor union here in the united states	70 70 70 70 70 79 79 79
depends on things that you are choosing	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
my life	76 79
also make money number one is	70 67 41 41 71 71
extended period of time and now they	49 44 71 53 53 53 50
And we know what the index is something like the S & amp ; P 500	76 79 79 76 76 79 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
that if you start investing at the age of 20	31 31 31 31 31 31 49 70 70 79
with a low down payment of five percent	19 19 10 10 19 19 19 20
do you want to become an actor of course	71 67 71 71 71 71 71 71 79
Now this kind of depends	1 1 21 21 31
all especially when you ' re comparing the	43 58 61 61 61 61 61 61
see you on set one day	79 79 79 79 0 0
number 11 is	71 43 70
that like button and also subscribe to	71 71 52 79 79 79 71
season so people probably aren ' t too	40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
money for example if you ' re trying to	70 70 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and millions of dollars and escape the	34 40 79 79 52 79 79
out now this is going to really depend	11 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
maybe you didn ' t do anything wrong	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
committed to this	70 70 70
you can create your own experience you	40 71 71 68 41 41 41
keep you	79 44
So the first one is forgetting about investing completely	49 49 40 31 31 31 31 31 71
hometown fast forward to 2013 and I was	70 70 61 61 70 70 40 40
of acting	71 41
yourself it was one of the first videos	71 71 41 41 42 71 71 71
floors just let my gym be free and then	50 50 49 19 19 19 19 50 49
the tax code is complicated but the	40 49 40 67 49 22 76
right i didn ' t have time to finish this	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 52 79 79
you ' re taking a 40 000	40 40 40 40 40 70 67
is on camera the reader is the person	49 49 76 76 76 73 73 73
or if you ' re hit with some kind of	70 71 50 50 50 49 70 70 58 70
highest income bracket meaning you	19 20 20 20 20
And so one of my housemates says	49 49 49 49 22 22 49
been the most popular video on this	41 44 71 71 71 71 71
or multi - unit you can always sell it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to just chat with you guys and help you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 79
and pay attention to the other person in	47 48 48 51 77 71 71 44
of being able to effectively	79 79 79 79 79
the second way to find auditions without	76 76 77 41 41 71 79
I ' m a junior doctor working in Cambridge	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

props are distracting and focus on the	58 31 58 58 58 55 58
when an actor walks in the room with a	70 70 70 67 67 70 70 70 70

and I ' ll be exposing all of my analytics	61 61 61 61 28 67 70 70 67 70

probably not going to be paid for these	49 50 41 41 41 50 50 50
from each of the videos	44 44 53 44 44
after the fact to decide to open up the	61 61 43 79 52 79 79 52 79

But if you ' re in the UK or the US	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 61 61

objectives and obstacles right	40 40 40 49
classes often offer	50 50 49
they only found out after the fact that	49 70 79 76 49 46 76 70
phone do not shoot your audition video	41 40 73 73 73 73 73
So realistic worst case scenario	70 79 79 79 70
started shooting the rest of the show	73 79 79 79 79 79 79
eight years later about how to study effectively	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in future episodes so you ' ll have to	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
broadway this isn ' t the big shows that	49 19 19 19 19 41 41 41 41
super cool they ' re like 150 to 200 for	0 49 49 49 49 49 49 40 41 49
There was a day a few weeks ago where I was doing this	70 67 67 67 67 67 70 67 70 70 70 70 70
that you want to change you know focus	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 52
close to within driving distance to one	80 49 79 71 71 71 71
are acting career regrets and i thought	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you ' re gonna be like what ' s happening	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
but they really do add up when you	71 71 70 70 67 70 70 70
income legally then make sure to	40 40 40 40 43 43
yourself then head over to brilliant	43 70 70 61 61 70
in my business these are the things i	79 79 79 49 79 79 79 79
don ' t have that full 20 % down and like	70 70 70 70 79 79 70 70 79 49 49

another audition i booked that role and	81 78 81 81 78 77 79
pressure like you have to go full time	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And I should instead invest in real estate	79 49 49 79 49 49 19 19
because all they need is a short little	49 49 49 50 50 50 50 50
in theater from high school or even	71 70 80 80 80 70 70
sides of it I can print my headshot on	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
me to rehearse and I can do this when	40 52 52 77 80 53 53 49 49

I have tons of classes on Skillshare	0 0 0 0 0 0 0

not work then this is actually I think	49 79 79 40 67 67 40 49
15 . 3 percent of your income is going	58 58 58 31 40 40 31 31 40
you don ' t know what the outcome is going to be	40 40 40 40 28 28 31 31 31 31 58 67
and I had a lot of comments on Instagram saying	70 70 70 79 79 70 70 70 70 70
potential work that was available to me	71 71 71 71 71 77 50

when they think about real estate almost	40 76 76 76 40 19 49
should really try to find the best	71 71 71 71 71 71 71

were doing it myself i ' d probably keep	79 79 79 79 70 70 70 79 79
really want to make money online then we	49 49 49 49 49 80 71 76
and therefore whatever I do in this environment	25 43 43 59 61 59 58 71
step number eight is to start	1 21 20 20 10 2
professional headshots and you ' ve done	70 70 79 79 79 79 79
gotta know your lines so you can please	29 32 32 29 33 32 32 32

you have to do is kind of dedicate	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
time living from a thousand true fans	49 49 49 49 40 40 40
you sign with is a reputable law ok guys	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 76 71
mortgage your property taxes and any	40 40 41 40 40 40
your first try you definitely will need	40 49 49 41 40 40 40
down on yourself understand that simply	79 79 79 79 79 67
if you don ' t have anything to show	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
or community model	41 41 41
now non - union productions	67 67 67 67 67

know Monday Wednesday Friday I know that	40 49 49 49 49 49 49
of us we ' re not making a living	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
out that door you need to leave the	76 76 73 76 50 50 50 50
super fun and i ' m excited to share more	71 68 68 68 68 68 68 41 71 71
where you	50 50
And so I ' ve gotta pay 9	43 31 31 31 31 31 58 58
the next bad money habit to break is	52 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
familiar with it	41 41 41
if those things are filled out correctly	70 43 40 43 43 43 50
fit the description is	52 52 79 52
Pretty much all of them I write	70 70 70 70 70 67 64
by them to your own homes or for	79 79 70 70 79 79 79 70
is not in stunts it can still be a great	51 81 81 81 50 51 51 51 81 81
pretty kind of magical system really but	76 73 73 76 76 77 76
there are actors who make a living by	67 70 70 49 49 79 79 71
and then getting two hours of sleep that is proper grim	77 77 76 76 76 77 76 76 76 76 76
like these days	40 58 58
best actor that you can possibly be	77 77 77 77 80 77 77
they would probably keep me in mind for	79 52 25 25 52 52 25 25
We had music in the background	21 21 21 21 0 21
in whatever city you currently live in	80 79 79 76 79 79 70
and you do like thousands of them then I	61 70 79 79 79 71 80 80 79
different things and you ' re not having	79 49 49 41 41 41 41 41
you think I ' m gonna go and compare my	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 41 41
actually do want to mention one other	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
sandwiches okay so my actual response	41 49 49 41 41 71
depending on the website	64 64 64 67
buyers that will probably relate to us	79 70 70 70 70 70 79
yourself for auditions and talent	71 70 71 71 71
For this business we have a membership community	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
what ' s up my fellow actors kurt you here	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
as well as his youtube channel down in	77 77 77 79 79 79 80 80
part about conventional loan is that	44 71 40 40 40 40
But I think gamification	71 71 71 71
beginning of the day they ' ll hand you	76 73 73 73 76 76 76 76 76
you have to make offers you have to	41 41 41 41 40 41 41 41
so that ' s the same thing for an actor	40 68 68 68 68 62 71 71 71 43
And that ' s actually quite fun	77 77 77 77 77 77 77
and you know get more profit for	79 79 79 79 79 79 70
since i ' ve made a video maybe over two	68 71 71 71 71 71 71 43 53 41
while you ' re trying to study because you ' re never	79 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
hundred dollars then you ' re just not	31 31 32 32 32 32 31 40
how did you know you sorcerer so let	49 79 79 79 79 49 77 50
light on my nightstand and I ' ll get into	73 73 73 76 79 76 76 76 76 79
if i had let that stop me i wouldn	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
production i mean	80 50 50
you just need to to move around you just	40 40 40 40 40 50 50 50 50
that that money will still be worth exactly the same	79 70 70 70 71 70 71 71 70 71
horizontally save those vertical videos	73 76 76 76 76
bringing in three thousand dollars	19 19 19 19 19
and joy and happiness and money and we	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52
where I can do some housekeeping to make things	40 49 43 44 50 50 50 50 50
of a product conflict is that if you	68 68 68 68 68 68 68 67
agency that submitted they might only be	76 76 76 76 73 73 76
scenes set up and shot felt a lot faster	43 40 40 40 40 76 76 80 80
when i auditioned for the show cobra kai	76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
like a like a slow push in for dramatic	79 79 73 73 73 73 73 73 73
section is commercials	0 0 0
let ' s say you ' re above a 740 which puts	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 67
money and that ' s ultimately not very	0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2
also subscribe to my channel to see more	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the producers will get together and	70 70 71 79 70 80
But it ' s also gonna be really interesting to look back on	80 53 53 53 50 50 53 53 79 79 70 67 70
is required the amount of hours that	31 31 37 31 31 31 31
know it can be scary	79 79 79 79 79
workouts you know that ' s not something	49 49 50 41 41 41 41 41
starting today and you can catch my	64 67 67 67 71 71 71
designer and get hired by companies	67 67 67 40 40 67
questions as i can	79 49 52 53
just like looking at the scale every day	11 14 11 38 29 38 41 42
to actually consistently beat the market	49 46 40 71 49 71
a lot of people actually never switch	40 40 40 70 70 70
month for PMI that ' s actually not too	0 0 0 0 0 0 79 76 79
but to be honest I don ' t think anyone	71 71 71 40 40 67 67 67 53 26
let ' s take me back to the wall sits in	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 40 40
netflix youtube premium hulu disney plus	79 79 79 79 79 79
had a lot to talk about	71 71 71 40 79 79
auditions that i did	80 80 76 76
you are already working hard because the	68 68 68 67 67 67 67
take it easy and just know that you can	40 49 49 49 49 49 49 40 40
your project	77 68
Point number four	79 79 79
but they would be able to instantly turn	40 49 46 49 49 41 41 41
as well as the big lesson that i learned	41 41 41 41 41 41 71 44 71
have finished writing the script	76 79 71 71 71
should not need an extended warranty all	79 79 70 70 70 70 52
i never have to join the union	49 52 52 49 50 50 50
using Amazon ' s FBA Fulfilled by Amazon programme	49 40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41
alright let ' s get back to it now one	68 79 79 79 79 19 0 0 0 0
is do you regret not starting your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
a cheaper car then it ' s probably better	49 76 76 40 40 40 40 31 31
get your own real estate license that	41 40 31 31 40 40 41
in which case this will be netflix	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in the united states agents make a 10	52 52 52 52 79 79 70 71
a certain amount of money for plugging that within my video	76 67 71 71 71 71 71 71 0 0 0
you do	41 79
doing it plus at the end we now have	79 70 49 53 53 50 50 71 71
in the U . S or the NASDAQ or the Dow	70 76 76 76 76 43 76 70 76 79 80
what the hell is an index fund	31 58 67 67 67 70 76
I don ' t book it but guess what ten	70 70 70 70 80 80 80 80 80 80
this all adds to your experience as an	50 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
affect you in so many ways so	79 79 79 79 79 76 76
is the cause or that is the result of	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
around now do not have someone try to	21 21 48 50 49 10 1 1
like Los Angeles or New York well guess	80 80 79 70 70 70 70 70
able to hear what their responses are to	67 64 73 73 73 67 67 67

you make money from royalties that is passive income	80 80 76 73 76 76 76 67 40
home purchase without anything down so	70 70 70 70 79 79
different what works in one city might	79 70 43 61 70 61 70

in 2015 through 2018 and I had a couple	49 37 40 40 40 46 46 46 46
That is one of those things that when you ' re 18	79 79 79 80 71 70 70 79 70 70 70 79
" Oh I ' ve read this book	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19

hundreds and hundreds of people	70 70 79 79 79
my own personal pages I also posted it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and played The Witcher 3 for like two hours	67 67 68 68 67 76 76 76 67
And that will give you roundabout $ 100 a month	49 41 41 41 40 58 58 58 55 59
stuff but there ' s no other things like	67 41 41 41 41 32 49 67 67
so here are three ways to prove to them	68 68 68 67 67 67 68 71 68

shrink it down to the Cliff ' s Notes	68 41 68 68 71 71 71 71 71
most obvious reason is of course to	79 79 79 79 70 71 79
close to a thousand auditions now	76 76 76 76 41 44
feeling super confident because of how	71 49 41 71 71 41
But the ones that you should definitely check out first	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49 67 70
do i regret not starting my acting	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
where when I ' m pushing play and when I	67 67 67 67 67 67 40 40 40 40
reason down below	71 71 71
website is	0 0
and then other days you get to the honey	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
payments you need to	40 40 40 40
that is that it ' s really quite hard to	40 40 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
of how in general the casting process	19 49 49 49 49 43 43
in the last 28 days 11 , 618 pounds	64 64 67 64 67 71 71 71 71
the tuition	40 70
completely off book yet but you also	49 49 49 40 40 40 40
- So I recently bit the bullet	49 49 71 71 71 71 71
from those anxieties when they go to university as well	41 41 41 41 41 41 44 44 41 41
women you played amy	0 0 0 0
in atlanta who ' s a friend of mine his	71 71 68 68 68 68 41 41 41 41
i ' ll put a link to it below	41 41 41 41 41 71 68 68 41
can also speak with a real estate agent	70 70 79 61 71 63 63 70
how and where to find auditions well in	40 50 53 80 79 41 68 68
makes sense on why a demo reel is so	49 40 43 43 67 67 68 68 69
what the rules are and what the	40 67 70 40 40 40 40
interest now whatever money you	71 71 40 40 40
how was i offered that role because one	49 52 52 52 52 76 76 67
to that graphic designer example	40 40 37 64 64
recommend trying to get multi	31 31 43 52 79
and commercials	79 79
they definitely will do things the right	78 50 41 71 71 71 71
is that now you have someone on your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
reel well here ' s something that i did	71 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 50
is that the actor who played my patient	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
already a member of one of their sister	71 71 71 50 53 80 80 71
talent agency to get representation but	70 70 40 70 70 79
line was to start the rehearsal but of	52 52 52 43 43 49 49 50
That sort of stuff	49 52 49 49
director even reached out after he said	41 50 50 50 50 50 50
more opportunities to get	71 71 49 79
won ' t last that long and in that case	0 0 0 0 0 31 40 40 40 40
let ' s say it ' s for burger king and then	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
where you live right now also what if	71 71 71 71 70 70 70 67
step one develop a skill that others are	76 73 46 40 64 67 64 67
for it i promise you it is so	71 40 40 70 79 41 41 41
in this case for an actor you may need a	41 71 71 50 80 80 43 52 40 41
part of human communication and thus it	49 49 40 43 43 40 41
and fitness into their lives so before	50 50 50 49 49 49 49
your acting career and i think that ' s an	71 71 71 71 68 68 68 68 68 71
' cause I ' ve been listening to it for years	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
one is going to come to you and you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
are they a credit for your resume	40 40 40 70 70 70 70
steer my answer towards talking about my	67 40 41 41 68 71 71
So let ' s use a side hustle assessment matrix	67 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 55
going with a 30 - year fixed because the	40 40 40 40 40 40 67 40 40
in rental income which is 10	76 52 61 31 40 43
people you know one they only need 30	37 37 37 37 40 40 28 37
it in so many other videos and i ' m going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is how do we make ourselves do things	49 49 41 41 49 49 71 70
can certainly help with getting you	79 79 79 79 80 71
so it really just depends on incide ly	49 46 46 46 46 37 19 19
leaves you with a lot of time to work on	40 40 67 40 40 40 40 40 67 67
overseas get an agent in the united	50 53 53 53 50 41 41
fifteen you know it ' s going to depend on	50 49 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
actors even there even though you ' re not	49 49 50 46 46 46 46 46 46
way too fast now i know when you sign up	79 79 79 71 41 41 40 70 79 79
especially when you get to the	40 40 40 40 40 49
it ' s much more beneficial for someone	71 71 71 41 71 71 41 53
for Instagram and tick tock your	76 76 76 76 76 76
because it means that my brain is then	52 70 70 70 52 52 52 52
And just the fact that I had all of that stuff written down	52 52 52 19 19 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50
amazing thing is if you actually live in	20 20 19 19 19 19 19 19
can and willing to do	71 71 71 71 71
school and you ' re currently working a	76 79 49 49 49 49 49 49
to help you learn the lines the third	41 71 71 41 71 71 68 41
especially if you don ' t have any experience	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
pure color it ' s gonna make the	79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79
and it represents actors in film	71 41 52 80 50 44
look at some of the oscar - winning actors	41 41 41 41 41 49 49 49 41
the real estate exam	49 49 40 40
has one printable side I like printing	76 79 79 79 79 79 79
you would need to run about 60 , 000 subscribers	76 67 76 76 67 67 58 58 58 58
That ' d be pretty good	63 63 63 63 62 49
entitled to take this right off a lot of	61 43 43 62 62 31 40 49 49
they ' re kind of considered on a level	19 19 19 19 19 49 49 49 49
lighting it dark leave that for the	67 68 65 65 69 69 68
value and renovating it now if you	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
Like people are doing very well	49 41 41 41 41 41
five million dollars and even more than	79 79 79 79 79 76 76
like depending on what the regulations are	67 70 70 52 70 70 70
loans since 2013 so hopefully that gives	0 0 0 41 40 49 49
from your own	31 31 31
too good for their listing that ' s why	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
popular show I ' ve ever worked on it	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 68
knows right I mean there ' s no way to	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and figuring out what needs to be done	67 76 76 79 79 52 52 52
not enough or um any other thing	70 79 71 71 49 79 79
of you the camera sees through its lens	71 70 70 71 71 71 71 44
career okay i hope that was helpful if	52 71 71 71 71 71 71 68
so i don ' t want you to feel this	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
definitely recommend if some of these 12	79 43 79 79 70 70 40
but also don ' t treat it as something evil because you know	76 76 79 79 79 79 76 79 76 76 79 79 79
amongst the top 500 biggest companies in the US	49 49 49 70 49 79 71 71 79
jobs here in atlanta before i	71 80 77 77 72 71
and I just kind of lay on my sofa	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
rent what you ' ll do is you ' ll find the	31 10 10 10 10 10 1 1 1 1 1 1
making five or $ 10 a month from YouTube	68 67 68 67 67 68 68 68 68
So there ' s basically two bits to understand here	76 76 76 76 67 67 79 76 79 70
and then we we shot the commercial on	41 41 41 42 68 68 41 31
about the types of credits	77 77 77 77 77
audition because it ' s the only step that	70 50 50 50 50 50 50 44 50
a little bit different so if you value a	40 40 40 67 40 40 40 40 40
you 10 different ways that actors make	40 40 40 71 71 71 71
step number seven is to learn how to	71 1 21 19 21 21 1 21
it takes about up until 2013	0 0 1 31 79 52
but i really want to play in the nba so	67 67 67 67 68 68 68 68 68 67
our scene and once we got inside he had	41 41 41 41 76 76 76 67 67
Hollywood megastar	71 71
Tesla or Netflix or Amazon and how	31 34 71 79 71 79 79
would recommend you probably stay away	20 20 20 0 76 76
when I first started making I don ' t know	70 43 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 79
facebook groups	52 49
transactions as well as starting to	79 79 79 79 79 79
marketing the house is really important	79 79 79 43 79 79
and think about what are the victory conditions of that game	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
buying these rental properties is for	37 37 31 31 40 40
the point where they don ' t even look	76 76 76 77 71 71 71 71 71
for the most part look at it this way	70 79 76 67 67 71 71 70 70
that ' s doing all the types of projects	76 76 76 73 80 80 80 80 80
this project is not just a question to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when you are non - union but whether or	71 71 80 67 67 67 67 67 40
to a cafe or a coffee shop or a restaurant	79 79 70 71 71 71 71 79 79 79
I say for at least two years	67 67 67 67 68 59 58
if this is your first time here make	41 41 50 77 68 68 67 46
with these are the things that you shoot	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and if it wasn ' t one of the ones I	41 41 44 71 71 71 71 71 71 41 49
and there are so many different types of	71 68 68 68 71 71 71 71
up to three thousand dollars now the	71 71 71 71 71 67 67
let ' s say the director ' s name was donna	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you should read those sooner than you did	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
payments for the next 30 years the last	44 53 53 80 80 40 40 40
the time or if you ' re not working all	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
appliances they mostly will not break	71 71 43 70 70 71
So again using my friend Oliur as an example	63 63 63 63 63 62 63 63 62
that to cast multiple roles	70 52 79 79 79
you know what medication they were on	0 0 0 0 0 0 1
once you do sign with your first agent	71 71 71 71 71 71 52 49
In this video I ' m gonna go over 21 bits of advice	71 71 62 62 62 62 62 71 71 59 59 59 59
first let me welcome those of you who	41 41 41 41 49 49 49 49
So let ' s say I make a video about I don ' t know	44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44
and I read for that character after I	64 67 67 67 67 64 76 76
director said	77 77
and always have a rental agreement in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
definitely scrape those off repaint it	79 76 79 79 79 79
it will be linked to the little playlist over there	0 32 41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40
agent after that so in this video I want	40 67 40 70 70 70 67 70 67
happens all over the country there are	67 80 80 50 76 76 76
that sale and if enough	51 51 51 51 27
figure out which two are the most useful	40 40 70 70 70 70 70 40
size recessed lights you want so you can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to make an online course	41 41 41 41 49
So if you like this video	70 70 70 70 70 70
online course it ' s going to be important	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
solid foundation for your business is	76 76 70 70 76 67
great lessons learned and it also just	22 49 22 22 49 49 49
if you liked it please give it a thumbs	71 71 71 71 70 71 71 71 71
might have to wait seven or eight hours	50 42 42 42 42 42 41 41
whistling and ends with you some	71 71 49 49 76 0
agent then	70 49
18t was like hey we have 300 we also	70 70 67 64 64 70 70 64 64
i must be terrible i quit that that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
physical on set	71 71 41
already and until next time keep	79 79 79 79 79 79
yourself you can use zillow rental	31 31 28 31 31 31
one it ' s a lot of fun two we ' re always	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79
therefore there are so many points where	40 40 40 40 41 41 41
doesn ' t usually have any costs associated with it	19 19 19 49 49 49 76 79 79 76
like I ' m currently doing in this video	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67
that does not go on your acting resume	71 71 71 41 71 71 71 41
And instead if you just held onto the house	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
understand that a great audition doesn	71 71 71 40 67 40
And then you get a general decline	64 64 64 70 67 67 67
definitely gotta make sure that you have	40 40 70 80 80 80 80
doesn ' t pay as well as film and	79 79 79 79 70 79 79 79 79
make money online magnifies a lot	76 49 76 49 41 50
then having to make your own website	52 43 70 70 79 49 79
anything like this where you can start	49 50 80 50 77 77 77
type of situation where it might be	40 40 40 40 40 40 31
and then you can maybe inch by inch get	73 73 73 73 73 73 73 73 73
my new course and this is the very last	79 79 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
obviously any amount of money that we	49 79 79 79 79 70 70
one was a male and one was a female now	50 53 53 80 40 40 40 70 70 70
That ' s all in the playlist over here	49 49 49 41 41 41 40 40 40
dollars in profit through their business	31 28 31 31 32 31
you great if going through the fast food	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
that were over 10 minutes long	64 67 67 67 40 40
they ' re only making minimum payments	70 70 70 70 61 61 70
people whatever it is you could try	22 19 19 19 49 49 49
So these days I use the app Drafts for that	49 43 43 40 40 49 40 49 49 49
and link people to it and everything	68 71 80 80 80 80 80
Academy and then trying to build your	21 0 0 0 21 0 0
is done being written once the writers	40 40 70 70 40 40 41
able to you know just elevate my brand	49 79 49 49 49 76 79 79
need to do practice questions	40 40 40 49 49
going to be running that scene with them	41 50 50 50 53 53 53 40
on set one day	0 0 0 0
my number one tip is to sign up for some	13 13 49 49 40 40 40 40 40 40
incredible medical emergency	0 0 0
If you ' re watching this and you have an issue	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 67 67 67 76
attention now there are all ways that	41 41 49 49 49 22 49
Basically the thing you ' re looking for	70 70 70 70 70 70 49 64
editor lily who currently edits all of	79 79 79 79 79 76 76
kind of how we sold it so fast and you	80 79 79 79 79 52 79 79 79 79
theater degree can be helpful but it	77 77 79 79 79 79 79
to someone that actually can ' t afford it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
then wire car to the website will make I	40 49 49 49 49 80 80 71 53
you reach a plateau	64 64 64 64
completely off - guard like I was when	79 71 71 71 71 80 80 68
of your income and you ' re not really the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
Now whenever we ' re in any sort of	52 52 70 70 70 70 52 52 52
at playing " World of Warcraft	41 41 41 41 50 50
thing that really is worth the life	76 79 70 70 70 61 70
social media because these tactics work	79 79 79 79 79 79
no that almost never happens in real life studies have shown that we maintain	71 71 71 71 79 79 80 71 71 71 71 49 71 68
Where I teach you the ins and outs	49 49 49 49 50 50 49 49
that I haven ' t talked about in this video	76 77 77 77 77 76 76 76 76 76
really think it ' s like pretty guaranteed	79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79
that are short - term painful in service to our future selves	70 40 40 40 40 40 68 67 67 50 49 19
is a great way to kind of just get your	41 41 40 41 41 41 41 41 43 40
skill that people are willing to pay for	80 80 49 49 49 49 49 79
get guaranteed business through your	19 10 40 31 31
your face and brings out your	50 50 50 50 49 53
over this how can that be our job so our	43 40 40 40 70 40 70 70 71 71
it ' s really important to have an inbox for your brain	79 79 79 80 76 79 79 67 67 67 70 76
and put the mother on whats welcome to world	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on the movie venom i didn ' t audition for	44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 53
when we ' re the ones talking so unless it ' s a deeply	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50 50 50 50 41 41
who has a stable income and can help you	53 53 53 80 53 53 53 53 52
all good scripts and screenplays explore	50 50 68 40 50 50
movies and television shows	71 71 71 79
the only option but i do think that	49 49 49 41 41 41 41 40
that if you wanna be more productive	58 58 58 58 58 58 61
digital digital product business you	71 71 71 79 79
right there the third way to find	26 67 67 68 68 41 41
auditions now not every audition will	71 67 70 67 67 70
you got to understand that a demo reel	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
who wants help and having that	79 79 79 76 67 76

There ' s nothing really sexy about the way	64 64 64 67 67 67 67 67 67
takes me away from this and all of my	23 23 50 41 50 38 49 41 50

But it just kinda gives you an idea	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 40
step number three is to learn how the	68 68 0 0 0 0 0 0

There ' s really no need to compete with your friends	70 70 70 79 79 70 70 70 70 73 73
and education	31 31
just doing a 30 - minute workout it	40 40 31 40 40 40 40 40
government because it means that you are	70 67 67 40 40 58 31
in whatever space you ' re in	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
and that ' s why you really need	79 80 80 80 79 79 79 79
see they want to get an idea of what	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that you really want to get started	79 79 80 80 80 80 80
column is the name of the show	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
very underused method but you can	40 49 40 40 40 49

That means that in 10 years time	70 49 49 79 79 79 70
the more it compounds	52 25 25 52
how much you spend in your business how	79 79 76 76 67 68 71 80
which can come in really handy sometimes	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And so the idea behind the Reitoff Principle	64 64 67 67 67 64 67 67
Now again this is generally a bad idea	41 40 49 49 49 49 67 67
of the three levels of making money	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to tell you how much of a genius I am	71 41 71 71 71 71 68 71 71 71
is to prove to them that you already	53 80 80 80 49 49 49 49
might be amazing to others	52 52 52 52 52
you already have	49 49 49
I think about 10 years ago	49 49 49 49 49 76
they wait until the last minute before	77 77 76 76 76 67 49
why would i waste my time looking at the	67 40 40 40 40 67 70 70 43
i think i auditioned two or three times	76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
that shaq was involved in this	41 71 71 71 71 71
auditions without an	71 79 41
it ' s super blown out though so you	49 49 49 43 40 0 0 0 0
countertops I ' ve ever seen in the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
thank you so much for sticking around	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
how do we actually enjoy the things that we ' re doing	49 49 49 19 19 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
of effort on their part and they just	40 40 40 68 40 40 40 53
I still pay 19 % corporation tax on the remainder	40 50 50 49 49 52 49 79 79 49
but then they find out somebody else did	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
you learn the skills you need to break	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 67
from it is reasonably passive	58 58 58 58 58
we ' ve seen prices skyrocket in the last	53 53 53 43 43 80 71 71 71
of find your passion and do what you love	79 79 79 79 67 73 64 64 79
city and every state i don ' t know what	49 49 79 52 52 80 80 80 70 70
actor as always if you have any	49 49 41 41 41 41 37
your upfront mortgage insurance premium	0 0 0 0 0
think those are two	41 41 41 49
the things that I ' ve had this	49 49 50 50 50 50 50 49
I think if I ' d been doing it myself	43 43 71 77 77 77 77 77 64 64
think about this	71 71 71
And so in the UK the system is different to the U	51 51 51 70 70 40 49 79 49 49 49 49

income is uncapped what i mean by this	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
right eye and then give you a thumbs up	37 37 76 76 76 76 76 76 73
but you ' ll remember the feeling of camaraderie	79 79 79 79 79 79 49 79 71
Which is that kind of sorting out the email inbox	52 49 52 52 49 49 49 49 52 53
are for some reason still way too big to	49 49 49 49 76 79 79 79 80
this by yourself unless you have	79 79 79 79 79 79
live on zoom so not in person again	67 67 40 41 68 68 41 49
if you do disagree let me know down in	64 68 67 67 64 67 65 64 67
hook is when you ask them for something	53 53 26 53 71 71 68 68
think of things in terms of opportunity	70 79 70 70 70 67 79

I do not shy away from using props in	35 68 59 71 71 71 71 71 71
And then there are domain specific fundamentals	70 79 52 70 70 70 70
and three they don ' t need anything other	40 40 37 40 40 40 40 40 40
companies out there so whenever you	79 79 70 70 79 70
into the film and television industry	71 71 71 71 71 71

you will get more auditions from them	40 79 80 71 71 41 41
and if it ' s a high profile project they	40 76 49 49 49 49 49 49 40 49
on tv and they want to be in movies but	79 80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

again if someone is inexperienced	79 79 79 79 79
auditioning and career advice every	67 67 67 67 67
so that ' s why I decided to make this	41 41 41 41 50 79 79 79 40 41
the file on our computer with our first	68 68 68 68 68 68 77 77
rehearsal the point here is that I	77 77 77 77 77 77 77
for the generic name of the product take	70 62 70 70 70 71 71 71
definitely recommend this for all	40 40 67 40 40
of the day - to - day tasks so my team has	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 71 49 79 79
But as I talk about in that video about stocks	70 70 79 79 76 76 76 79 79 49
but i just booked my very first speaking	49 49 49 49 49 41 71 71
separate entrance	79 79
and she just wrote a hundred blog posts	40 40 49 76 70 49 79 49
on your resume and they show that you	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
and got my license from real estate	43 44 53 53 53 53 40
this is something that my brother and I	70 43 52 52 43 70 67 40
with the word interest don ' t worry stick to it for now	76 67 67 70 70 70 70 67 67 67 70 46 38
a priority to me in my business not just	71 71 71 71 71 71 49 49 76
and definitely shouldn ' t say in response	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
all homebuyers in general they only put	68 76 70 70 71 52 79
Point number eight is another idea	70 70 49 49 79 79
they want to avoid that at all costs and	43 70 70 70 70 70 70 67 71
series regular lead supporting principal	0 0 0 0 0
It ' s all just doing the right things consistently	41 41 41 71 71 44 44 71 41 44
of pocket each and every month but	61 79 79 79 79 79 79
you ' re just getting started and you go	49 49 49 49 52 52 71 67 64
look I get it	49 52 52 52
how to connect flow desk and show it and	49 49 49 46 46 41 41 41 41
understand that theater acting is	79 76 79 79 79
you know people have already signed up for the thing	49 49 49 79 79 79 67 43 71 71
do that you know walking is great and 30	40 49 50 50 50 50 49 49 49
join the union because	80 80 50 50
right you got to think about this	68 71 44 44 44 50 80
residuals okay let ' s move on to today	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
down with an interest rate of 3 and a	11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11
past him	53 23
to see what the stock market is doing	70 70 67 76 70 70 76 40
home off the market wasting a lot of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
experience that you would get	71 68 67 41 40
You might as well hit your ride with the whole market	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 71 50 49 49
con the content topic obviously the	79 79 79 79 79 79
skill than acting knowing how to act as	40 80 80 40 40 40 40 40
there is something big	40 40 40 49
consumer too because it allows them to	70 70 61 70 70 70 70
years you will need it to the world	71 68 71 71 71 50 50 50
especially if you ' ve given them so much	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
hired i know people who have worked on	80 50 49 49 49 67 70 67
it ' s your brand visuals all of those	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
consideration for this commercial	67 64 64 67
that you ' re consuming and the stuff that you ' re creating	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
or a " Hey here ' s how you kind of play poker online ."	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
and 1 . 5 is about 3 % of the total S & amp ; P 500	49 49 49 49 52 50 53 53 80 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
quit our jobs and stick it to the man	40 71 71 35 71 71 71 71 71
it and it saves money which I think most	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
word for word that I ' ve been following	49 49 49 49 41 41 41 40 49
And finally point number 21 please please please	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
But with some channels like Casey Neistat for example	67 67 67 40 49 76 49 40 49
because the audition is not the only	49 79 79 71 79 79 79
one was a deputy now for the sheriff	49 49 49 46 49 40 40 73
is looking at you and you say i want	79 79 79 67 67 41 41 41 40
which means these days	0 71 41 70
and according to the commercial	80 71 71 72 70
self - employed you need to have tax	40 40 40 40 40 13 13 13
the front and then on the back should be	49 49 50 50 53 49 49 49 49
middle of my audition to hear the	79 79 79 79 49 79 79
but just know that if you decide to join	79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70
a full movie script can have 50 or more	49 49 49 52 79 67 49 46 49
and that is the Reitoff Principle for productivity	49 49 76 76 50 50 50 49
i can just wait for my agent to call	19 19 19 76 76 65 65 64 64
I can be like I said walking my dog and	52 43 43 70 70 70 70 70 67 40
and The Stormlight Archive by the way	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actors commercial actors as well as some	71 71 71 71 71 80 68
Sunday 23rd of August 2020 711 pounds in a day	4 0 0 0 41 13 22 22 23 23
few people there and horses here you can	71 71 71 68 68 71 71 71
And I was like " Oh my God Molly you ' re right ."	79 79 79 79 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
if it were easy everyone would do it so	41 41 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
those obstacles out of the way to make	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
camera simply means to angle your face	70 40 40 40 40 40 49
you one really good way to get started	49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41
non - union productions that have been	79 79 79 70 76 49 49
shows and that ' s because	68 71 71 71 71 40
like I ' m still gonna give it my all	80 53 53 53 53 26 25 25 53 53
my name is inigo montoya	21 20 22 19 12
don ' t apply in right to work states in	49 49 49 79 79 79 50 53 53 50
about making money online	71 80 67 68
of when you have someone with experience	80 81 81 81 81 81 80
we ' re going to talk a little bit today	49 49 49 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you first have to join the YouTube Partners Programme	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Like everything becomes easier	49 79 79 79
where I flew with some other friends	52 52 52 52 43 70 70
interesting on set experiences I ' ve ever	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
And it ' s only really gonna happen once	65 65 65 65 65 68 68 68 77
And as they say on the market floor	41 50 50 44 44 44 80 80
so that is when i will be watching the	67 68 68 71 71 71 71 71 71
it ' s a free video transcoder called	40 40 40 71 71 71 71 71
Well you know it ' s very easy to create an ebook	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
So the key difference between those is	73 76 76 76 76 76 67
better than these agents then you can	79 79 52 79 79 79 79
All right nearly there	59 59 58 59
spending some time here with me today	77 77 77 68 68 71 68
good financial habits within me	49 67 31 31 58
out two more things that I did in that	68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68 68
your agent or casting director or	79 79 76 79 76 76
Basically you should start investing as soon as possible	79 79 49 79 52 79 79 44 49
it costs a load of money	49 49 49 49 49 49
every single audition is a win even if	76 76 79 76 79 79 79 76
that we do often have to do things that we don ' t wanna do	49 49 41 41 41 41 49 49 50 49 49 49 49 49 49
how close do you match the character	41 80 70 70 40 70 70
right so make sure you start	41 41 41 41 71 71
you for your services essentially	79 79 79 52 19
submit to them	41 71 76
But now anytime the book sells	49 79 80 50 80 80
chance and	71 68
And in terms of getting started	49 49 49 49 49 49
pretty good size and each room has a	0 0 0 0 79 79 79 79
and even months doing it using ineffective study techniques	76 52 70 71 80 49 71 71 70
set because they have that experience	79 79 79 79 79 79
And often that would mean that it ' s actually not worth	51 50 46 51 51 46 51 51 51 51 51 51
drawback that most actors don ' t really	80 77 76 76 79 79 79 79
179 using bonus depreciation	31 31 31 40
in this industry because it gives you	71 71 71 71 71 50 50
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for	41 41 41 41 41 41 70 79 41 41
see some differences in terms of it	40 40 40 50 50 50 77
it ' s a union project that check ' s gonna	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actors and what you should do if you	41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49
finances i know that can be really	79 79 79 76 79 79 79
that comes your way you can be patient	41 41 41 41 50 41 41 41
or whatever you wanna call it is gonna be fun	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50
you don ' t want your first ever acting	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80 79
like button	40 41
it ' s really a way of the government	79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70 70
because they want to have someone	55 31 31 58 31 31
my commercial experience and that ' s the	50 50 40 40 40 40 40 41
they think oh i know who would be	77 80 77 80 80 80 80 80
And for me basically a hundred percent	31 31 31 49 49 49 49
so I ' d be paying 9500	49 79 79 79 52 80 51
as an employee since you ' re also the	31 31 31 40 31 31 31 31 31

should be working on monologues because	50 50 80 53 71 44
then connect the two of you	79 79 79 79 79 80
should be paying for when you	41 71 71 71 71 71
ten commandments of self taping did you	71 71 71 71 49 49 49
" positive result and the present slog	61 61 61 61 61 61 61

it ' s not exactly easy on your pocket	70 70 70 71 70 70 70 79 79
where you can connect with people and	49 40 41 41 41 41 41
the way that he verbalized it it just	29 29 32 32 32 33 33 32
straight to the point but what we look	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
that ' s a huge plus because you	79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76
okay that ' s fine i ' ll still live out of	79 79 79 79 49 79 79 79 49 49 79 76
you have to shop around it ' s crazy but	70 70 79 79 70 70 70 70 70 70
done really well selling this switch pod	40 40 37 37 40 49 49
which I think is probably the biggest in the world	40 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 49
and I would ' ve thought no go home	22 22 22 22 22 13 13 14 14

straightforward but I do want to make a	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
So people who learn stuff actively in their adult life	19 49 52 79 52 52 70 70 67 67
all these different things that a lot of	28 28 1 1 28 28 1 28

out game rom disney and with me every	76 76 76 77 79 79 79 76
and that they are really serious about	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
language and I did that in 2006 with	50 53 50 50 50 50 50 76
for example if we ' re buying a fancy suit	81 54 27 27 27 27 3 3 3 3
meaning your all in cost is going to be	20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
And so just understanding recognizing this distinction	40 67 67 67 67 70 37
offer and sell and you have clients that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
marvel and that ' s it and you you ' ll have	49 49 49 49 49 49 43 50 52 52 52 43
have any trouble selling it or renting	70 79 79 79 79 79 79

actually get the license itself the	40 40 40 40 40 76
long day on set or if you ' re rehearsing	46 46 46 37 40 40 41 41 41 41

Firstly think about the game that you ' re playing	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
why you ' re doing this thing or why	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
seen lots of people transform those	79 79 79 79 79 79
on disney plus for all subscribers for	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
project that i was in	79 79 79 79 79
save a little bit of money	79 76 76 76 76 71
self submit for but remember to select	76 76 76 76 79 79 80
and they ' re repainting their bedroom but	40 79 79 79 43 43 43 70
camera what ' s the solution keep doing it	71 49 49 49 49 49 41 71 71
uh fit into a demo reel then you may end	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
earlier if you are looking for a place	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
haven ' t heard brilliant is an amazing	21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21
know when you should go full time	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because that episode continues to get	70 53 50 50 71 71
description below if you ' re at all	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 68
at its core money is just a medium for	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
where a traditional classroom run by a	79 70 79 79 79 79 79
video and that was my	79 79 79 79 80
written copy and i also have a video	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
very common in the industry in the last	71 71 71 71 71 49 79 79
that i want you guys	79 79 79 70 63
And so if your CPM is $	61 79 79 79 79 79 79
and you can check out my class	10 37 40 40 49 50 20
to a storage unit and guys this costs a	40 40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41
but as you ' ve done a little bit of work	50 50 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
now i ' m not talking about being like a	49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50 50 50
For example let ' s say I were managing a fund	80 80 80 80 80 53 71 71 71 71 71
our first and last name in it so check	77 68 77 80 71 80 71 80 77
so since there ' s no life going on around us	71 70 71 71 71 67 53 49 76 79 71
or two but these types of roles on	71 71 70 79 76 40 40 71
city that is in the la metro area	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
i ' ve had chances to work on and audition	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
taking out that 50 , 000 pounds in cash instead	31 31 31 31 31 31 56 31 58 58
find something that brings a smile to	68 77 50 49 50 50 50
injury to like lose a good portion of	46 46 37 37 50 50 50 50
so that ' s why it ' s really important to	19 40 40 40 67 40 40 40 40 40 22
headshots inside it and go put it in	67 70 76 49 49 52 70 70
with you it ' s out there doing something	41 50 40 40 40 37 37 40 40
totally different story	62 62 62
looking at homes now one thing i want to	31 43 43 43 31 31 31 31 40
have been doing that	80 80 81 78
this is the reality of the life of an	71 79 79 79 79 79 79 71 71
alright let ' s talk about headshots we	80 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
what you ' re going to do is you ' re going	50 50 50 50 71 71 53 80 80 80 80 80
agents are looking for people who are	68 41 65 64 65 68 68
doesn ' t have	49 49 49 49
headshot well	41 79
is called	0 0
there are so many things that you can	1 1 1 79 67 67 40 70
but you got to go to pittsburgh in a	64 37 38 41 41 71 71 71 71
or if let ' s say it was on camera class	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
me remember to check out his youtube	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
next audition the stepping stone to your	79 73 73 73 73 73 73
how might this expenditure change if i	10 10 11 20 20 10 0
the fourth way to find auditions without	68 41 41 71 71 71 52
or so people say or at least the thing that I do	79 79 79 70 79 79 79 79 56 58 58 58
you can just take classes at a private	67 76 76 77 71 71 68 41
you had invested $ 2 , 400 in the S & amp ; P 500	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 62 62 62 62 62 62 62
of PMI you pay is also based on your	70 70 70 70 70 43 70 79 79
and we ' ll talk about that a little bit more	79 79 79 79 79 25 25 52 79 79 79
or about being disciplined	-179 -179 -179 -179
It ' s absolutely okay to fall behind	72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72
types of projects that you are allowed	77 80 80 77 77 77 80
but they were nice enough to say the	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 77
um and let me know if you have any	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 79
of that it ' s like well maybe we change	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
let ' s say	52 52 52 79
classes each week for thirty minutes so	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
getting representation whether that ' s an	53 77 49 49 49 49 76
and where you may or may not need to be	40 40 40 77 70 70 41 71 71 71
secondly is this expenditure of life	1 1 10 1 1 1
you will find industrial videos and	41 41 41 41 41 41
going to survive when acting ' s not	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
instead save yourself a lot of money and	49 49 79 70 70 70 70 61
but if you just held onto your one Apple share	0 0 0 0 21 47 70 67 40 40
which time was $ 79 and 75 cents	49 49 49 49 49 49 70 70
gonna be super important when it comes	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
so well that she can take what i do on	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 79
acting Career Center website that link	68 68 71 71 68 77
so that ' s why i consider it	80 80 80 80 50 50 80 77
So if we take a step back	50 50 50 46 40 52 50
and I always enjoyed that my mom was a	49 49 49 50 50 50 41 46 46
anybody who was cut from the project i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
on demand or let ' s say a streaming	71 71 77 50 50 50 50 50 40
I don ' t know where I came across this several years ago	67 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 61 70 41 51 51
to manage your money	19 22 49 49
with being that person be okay with being the person to set	50 50 50 50 50 50 44 50 41 41 50 50
now you can sell goods now you can sell	0 0 0 -29 0 0 0 0 0
best audition that i can	41 41 44 44 44
the house without actually coming here	0 0 0 0 0 0
don ' t have to do in your business	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
investment property so here you can see	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
important to me	43 43 70
but I ' ll tell you more about them later	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
want to be the best you should do it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you would write that name of the teacher	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
like the concept of money is quite hard	79 52 76 79 79 79 70 70
it is the sign	49 79 79 70
call back	71 52
seven hundred dollars per year which in	71 71 71 71 71 49 41
filmmaking communities and see if you	49 49 50 40 40 40
and also you know getting that	79 79 79 79 79 79
I ' ve done for the last eight hours or so	41 41 41 40 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and you ' ve lost 50 , 000 pounds	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
saved up but ideally you don ' t really	76 76 76 76 70 67 67 67 67
a badge and everything and she was the	52 52 49 79 76 52 49 41
just go in and find what ' s on sale and	40 40 40 41 41 41 41 41 71 70 70
my t - shirt if you don ' t recognize this	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
much work you want to put in and pretty	31 31 40 31 31 31 31 31 40
guidelines so they have to pay the	67 40 40 40 40 40 32
by using a website like Skillshare	63 59 58 55 61 61
for a lot of actors because we hear that	40 31 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
back on the market and it doesn ' t look	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And so a lot of YouTubers realised this	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
but then there is some personal use as well	51 50 51 15 54 54 14 18 51
which this company called Protege Partners LLC accepted	67 70 61 76 52 49 79 50
auditions before we get to the 10	74 74 76 76 76 76 76
making people buy things	50 40 40 40
along with a couple of other videos	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
i ' ve personally applied the principles	79 79 79 70 70 43 43
zone edition b efore and after the store	73 76 76 79 80 50 79 70
looks at your resume and wants to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
talks about that really illustrates this	79 79 80 49 79 79
songs of series the ocean you and some of	41 41 41 41 41 71 50 64 64
you ' re thinking I want to make money	40 40 40 50 49 49 49 49 50
on that show and if you didn ' t get a	41 41 41 41 37 37 37 37 37 37 37
obstacle that that holds a lot of people	40 40 40 49 49 49 49 49
real estate part - time but this is a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
these are small plays that are done	40 40 40 50 50 50 50
especially because this business	51 18 18 18
during my first year of business at a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
on tv the more a commercial is run the	71 71 53 53 53 53 71 53 50
self - taped audition is when an	41 41 41 49 76 76 79
and renting the unit out there are	40 31 31 40 41 41 41
the S & amp ; P 500 has actually increased by about 50	67 67 67 67 67 67 58 58 58 59 58 58 58
and might see some mid - roll ads during the video	49 49 41 49 49 49 49 49 41 40 40
through this residential income	21 10 10 1
stressor than it was like an enjoyment	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
pictures stand out so obviously the	79 79 79 79 79 43

all right on to the story of how i	37 46 49 50 41 41 71 71 71
give me a thumbs up remember to	79 79 79 76 76 77 50
situation throughout my entire audition	41 41 41 41 76
to different people and different friendship groups	70 61 58 61 61 79 79

now i want to talk about where you may	67 67 67 70 70 70 67 67 67
So watch time is quite important	67 40 41 41 41 41
off day today so we are recording this	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
okay i ' ll do it your way	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in the moment and they don ' t think of	43 70 70 79 79 52 52 52 52 79
personal life so if your business is not	80 80 80 79 76 79 79 79
from watching Paul Wesley and Candace	41 41 68 67 79 79
so in my opinion when you ' re just	70 70 70 70 67 67 67 67 70

your nutritional health it ' s just really	41 40 40 41 41 41 49 49
term book the room before i ' ll explain	77 77 77 80 77 77 77 77 77
work for me I like my carbs so and and	41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
kill where Steven Seagal was a	79 79 79 79 79 79
search for standardized patient after	40 40 40 40 80
and building wealth it ' s really both the	40 49 76 31 31 31 40 40 40
just drop and do a plank for no reason	41 41 41 40 40 40 41 41 41
memorized so if someone asks you are you	71 64 64 67 67 67 67 67
real estate on Saturdays and Sundays you	67 67 67 40 40 40 67
four on my list	17 70 70 70
from our coach and from the other	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
audition was for a commercial for a home	41 80 71 41 71 71 71 79
don ' t make those payments	31 31 31 31 31 31
All right so we ' re nearly there	70 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
idea about like when it came to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
table from someone that they	67 67 41 40 41
because it doesn ' t rely on any level of privilege	67 76 76 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79
now there ' s various different ways of	50 50 50 50 50 41 41 41
awesome it was a great conversation I	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
all of those types of experiences on	50 50 53 53 51 69 72
but I sort of reasoned at the time when I was 16	41 71 71 68 68 44 41 50 49 49 71 41
said earlier that the photo paper needs	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
You can subscribe if you like	52 52 52 52 52 70
but it might not make it completely free	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
like that she ' s actually the one writing	79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76 79
you actually aren ' t really earning very much money at all	40 40 67 67 67 67 67 67 68 71 71 71
the vanities the counter tops the sinks	70 79 79 70 79 79 70
year in 2021 i auditioned for a pilot	40 34 70 70 70 79 79 79
workouts yep you ' ll get that one	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
actually put down as low as three to	31 31 31 40 40 40 40 31
my agent was still impressed with all of	49 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
there were decisions that were made	34 61 34 34 34 61
maybe we were too tall for the role or	68 64 64 64 67 67 67 67 67
let ' s get into it	52 52 52 52 53 71
Because if you go first if you take the initiative	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79 50
This guy Safi is a writer and he talks about	46 40 49 49 49 49 49 49 70 50
you ' re going to hold yourself back from	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
where if you refer someone to sign up	61 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
moving to a bigger production market	76 79 79 79 41 41
state has their own specific course that	31 67 67 67 40 31 31
asked in commercial auditions so way	71 71 71 71 71 49
scene you ' ve reacted to the explosion	49 70 70 70 70 71 80 80
PMI payment instantly so no you won	70 80 80 40 70 70 70
the more you leave time for that money	70 80 80 81 81 81 41 41

put 20 % down when you ' re buying a house	79 80 80 80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
week you could write one or two blog	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
the first thing that people do these	79 76 76 76 76 81 81
probably not gonna want to go all	50 23 23 23 23 20 20
that I really can ' t remember where it ' s from	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in the room in front of the casting	68 77 41 41 41 41 41 41
Well this is actually kinda hard	62 62 62 62 62 62
test questions there ' s only a finite	79 79 70 70 70 79 79 79
credit card with an extended warranty	1 1 0 0 0 0
people will purchase right and so	79 79 79 80 80 80
we ' re at right now and even before the	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
through real estate Express which I very	40 68 41 41 40 40 40
and do it yourself then look at the	79 79 79 79 70 79 79 79
like corporate speak thing back in the day	41 41 49 49 46 76 49 49
down and leaning forward to talk to the	40 41 71 70 71 67 67 67
And then by the time you get to your second year	62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62
real estate full time try and find that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
from a talent agency is another huge	79 79 79 79 67 70 70
you ' re not going to make those same	76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
was to sit down at a desk kind of lean	41 41 49 49 41 41 41 41 71 71
more likely the whole process is gonna	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actual real growth in your business and	79 76 41 41 71 70 71
the wrong impression sorry I didn ' t get	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
bringing a headshot to your audition and	71 41 71 71 70 43 44
pay agents of 100 % we have training we	40 40 71 40 40 40 40 40 31
the main example of an industrial video	70 70 43 71 71 71 49
would be a typical cold - read situation	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
for it to get back to its normal level	61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61
much sense to invest fifty grand into	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actually use	79 70
foundations and our foundational	41 41 41 49
million dollars because people the real	79 79 79 79 79 79
to them they ' re going to ask for a	71 71 71 71 71 71 67 79 79 79
email list you have to spend time	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
own it would give them much more	71 71 50 41 41 41 41
be the type of person to offer to help	41 41 41 41 41 67 73 73 73
there might be a cut off for union	64 67 67 67 67 67 77 41
because to make an app it ' s actually quite hard	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 49
absolutely necessary to do that in fact	40 40 40 40 40 41 41
the reason i ' m wearing this t	49 41 71 71 71 71 71 71
where I explain how I got started	76 67 49 28 31 40 40
and ended up making I think like $ 300 , 000 in the course	41 41 49 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
reading self - improvement books and not	79 79 79 79 79 70 79
this is where we start to see some of	43 43 43 44 41 41 41 41 41
so that ' s something you should take into	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
audition for crying out loud so show	71 71 71 71 71 71 79
because we know we wanna be entrepreneurs	0 0 1 1 0 0 0
at learning Python which is the world	76 76 76 41 40 76 76
that ' s how you get your real estate	52 52 52 52 52 52 70 76 76
And so you the investor don ' t have to worry about this	79 79 79 79 79 49 49 49 79 70 70 70 70
so when I wrote out that sentence it	0 77 77 77 77 77 76 40
take that effort to get started to begin with	76 76 49 46 19 23 19 37 46
your real estate license and get into	70 41 71 71 79 79 79
trying to do because like you said	49 49 49 40 40 49 49
You ' re gonna have a lot of anxiety	76 76 76 76 79 79 79 79 79
open it up to people of other	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
people in kansas city right now are like	79 79 79 79 79 79 76 19
do research about the population trends	58 58 40 43 58 58
Is that don ' t worry that what ' s obvious to you is	67 67 49 49 49 49 71 79 79 79 52 79 70 41
but in terms of making $ 100 a month again	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49 41 41

of the things that we were talking about	79 52 79 79 79 79 79 79

city that you currently live in	70 70 70 71 71 71
finding anything it really is a complex	40 40 53 53 80 80 71
like to leave it off but i ' ll leave that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your budget how much house can you	79 79 79 79 79 79 52
things are things that you are paying	40 70 79 79 70 40 49
of actors who have done	40 40 40 71 67
and did the standard Youtuber thing	71 67 1 0 0 0
on multiple episodes you wouldn ' t have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
calvin klein or a victorious secret	40 70 70 70 71 71
doing this	49 49
it could be right justified i ' ll leave	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that only i can do and the only thing	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and they watched your acting ability	49 49 79 79 79 76
it ' s sort of like YouTube in that anyone	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
the difference and i will have to pay	49 49 76 79 76 49 49 49
either union	40 40
you on your first deal if you ' re in	40 40 76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79

we get some sort of routine and then	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
another reason why you should audition	79 79 52 79 79 79
an agent	67 67
i really want to encourage you to think	80 52 79 79 79 79 79 79
acting career	41 41
$ 100 , 000 a year in annual recurring revenue	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
that all of the great acting that we	49 19 19 19 19 19 19 49
possible for you to lose all your money	40 40 40 49 40 40 40 40
and depreciating over time	79 79 79 79
big lights on you	19 19 25 19
so in this video i want to share with	71 68 68 68 68 68 68 41 41
my groceries and I lunge you know to	50 50 41 41 41 41 41 41
calm now before I get into my thoughts	61 58 62 62 58 58 58 58
so in my mind i ' m thinking darn i did	49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 49 41 71
And you ' re thinking of getting a mortgage	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 40 70
see if that is happening	71 71 41 71 71
create a youtube link with your video	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
punctuation so a few years ago I was in	70 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
investor starts out like that and it	49 40 40 40 41 41 41
So it ' s okay to fall behind during term time	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 68 77 77 77
i get paid for no matter what and	79 79 79 79 80 79 79 79
now during the audition process for this	41 41 41 71 71 71 71
for example let ' s say that a character	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to emphasize here are not to rush to get	70 71 71 70 70 70 70 70 70
they are choosing to pay out a dividend	28 31 31 31 31 58 43 76
earlier when it came to pit education	79 79 79 79 79 79 80
so the way that you would put training	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
television show it ' s really important to	77 71 71 71 71 49 79 79
wait to see you on set one day	79 79 79 79 79 79 0 0
and in our scene you know all of the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the foods that you eat you know it	41 41 40 41 41 41 41 41
so start creating your own web series or	53 80 71 71 71 53 53 80
your actions and then finally end up at	50 50 51 51 51 51 51 51
that have provided safe working	79 79 71 71 71
they claim to get	67 67 37 64
estate agents don ' t want to pay for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
season one and season two of the show	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
people have begun downsizing their homes	49 40 41 21 0 0
and you ' re gonna you ' re gonna sabotage yourself	62 62 62 62 62 61 61 61 61 62 62
or the year that you got it and then the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
career route and	68 68 41
setting up the lights and the camera and	65 46 46 49 49 49 71 41
project to project so i ' m not gonna go	80 40 43 41 41 41 41 40 40 41
products I mean things like ebooks or	49 49 22 49 49 49 76
this house and kind of the steps I took	43 52 52 79 79 79 79 79 79
actors remind them of their ex what can	67 76 71 71 71 71 49 79
then i improvised some responses and	44 71 49 77 40 41
amount of leads for let ' s say a monthly	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
goes towards building your own credit my	31 31 31 41 41 40 40
it ' s just a lot easier to take that	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
lot of people are like well if I ' m not	49 49 46 46 46 46 49 49 49 49 49
on Skillshare like I do I have like nine of them	67 67 76 79 79 49 79 79 79 79 70
my shopping cart and i was like	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
had to jump through all of those hoops	67 64 67 67 67 67 67 64
so fast and yeah I just hope that all of	79 79 79 79 40 43 79 49 49 79
using the backup camera on your Toyota	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
movie or a TV show or a Netflix show or	67 70 43 79 79 79 70 52 52 49
succeed I want you to be that series	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
any age like yes even if you ' re 15 years	52 53 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 41
certain things that I ' ve tried like	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
on your earnings for the year so those	40 40 70 79 49 77 68 68
but he was never listed on the call	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
spending their time learning	79 79 79 79
or playing all the songs on the guitar	49 49 50 41 41 41 41 41
and carry they ' re the six things that	40 49 49 49 49 40 49 41 41
on camera but you ' re also learning how	50 53 50 50 50 50 49 70 49
that I learnt in 2019	52 79 79 67 64
runner and so we just kind of grew up in	22 50 46 46 19 46 46 46 49 50
learn before you get on to a higher	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
good to have a safety net because	31 31 31 31 31 31 31
one of the best ways to build long	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
harder to build those routines and build	40 40 43 43 43 43 43
those are the ones that you should get i	79 79 70 62 70 70 70 70 41
information in relation to work the way	68 64 64 73 76 79 41
angeles the bay area and new york it	76 79 79 49 79 79 79 79
like it ' s much easier to maintain a product	41 41 41 41 41 40 49 49 49 49
right to it the first way that we are	41 41 71 67 67 68 41 71 71
well it ' s pretty complicated and it ' s a	49 46 46 46 71 71 71 67 67 67 40
called to if it ' s something that you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your demo reel but you also get	71 71 71 71 80 80 49
immediately after signing you go get	71 71 49 49 50 50
And so for me for example I started investing in 2015	41 49 76 71 71 71 71 71 70 70 70
independent films and short films	41 40 40 40 41
buying photo paper for headshots is that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
is usually used internally	40 40 41 41
absolutely not focus on anything in the	80 79 79 79 79 79 79
on that but if you are in the us	71 70 70 67 68 68 68 68 68
recommend taking an online class if that	70 70 71 70 70 70 71
before they even get to you so sometimes	50 80 80 50 50 80 80 80
on the sort of exponential growth of YouTube revenue	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 65 65
of stainless steel appliances all really	79 79 79 79 0 0

industry standard so make sure your	76 76 76 76 76 76
seriously and look even if you did	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
But having said that again this is a longterm thing	49 79 79 79 79 76 80 80 80 79
participated in taking notes just like	70 70 79 70 79 67

word and and the word action	41 44 44 44 44 26
and butterflies with five or six nations	81 80 80 19 79 80 80
would really think about what are some	70 79 79 79 79 79 79
can set up a lot of automations so	49 53 53 50 49 50 49 49
what exactly are those agents looking	67 67 67 67 67 71
that I don ' t have any valuable skills	67 67 67 67 67 76 49 49 49
worked with over the past	80 79 79 79 79

food that I ' m eating am i trying to gain	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49

and that business card was printed on	77 77 77 76 76 79 76
sometimes need that extra bit of	49 49 49 49 49 49
because once you ' ve got the money in you just like set it	67 67 58 58 58 49 49 49 49 67 67 67 58 58

of that post - it note this is gonna be fun	67 67 40 40 40 50 50 50 49 49 49
Amazon doesn ' t offer nearly as much	41 41 41 41 40 40 41 49
That ' s sort of encouraged me to go to the gym a bit more	55 55 55 58 58 55 58 58 58 55 55 55 55 55 55

way to yours go are now and barriers and	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71

focused on passive income not only was i	79 80 79 79 79 79 79 79
And the nice thing is that once you ' ve made the course	37 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 58 55
Right so point number six is this idea of a flywheel	49 79 79 79 79 79 70 79 79 76 73
is that productivity to be honest	76 76 80 53 53 53
number six but actually this step is	40 40 31 31 31 40 49
commitment to be as low as possible so	80 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
types of things be sure to subscribe	79 79 79 71 74 73 73
gonna be obvious to others because it probably won ' t be	49 49 49 40 70 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
So let ' s say you ' re 24	79 49 49 49 70 70 70 70 70
first choice you ' re gonna have is what	76 71 80 80 80 80 79 79 79
and it ' s a license i ' ve had since 2017	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
why is that one is because they run out	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
And it will start getting recommended to people	49 49 49 49 49 53 54 54

chances are it ' s gonna be around 10 years from now	64 64 37 37 37 73 76 80 79 52 52 52
than a hundred dollars	49 49 49 49
is how this works for me is that when	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
through college	79 79
investing thank you so much and i ' ll see	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

so your part needs to be able to fit	49 49 49 40 40 40 40 49 49
but for example in 2000 there was a bit of a crash	70 70 70 70 70 70 67 67 67 70 43 61
show that you really want to be on as a	50 50 80 53 53 53 77 40 40 40
follow these steps i guarantee you	31 49 49 49 40 31
paper mistake number three forgetting to	71 1 2 1 1 1
if I put my money in stocks and shares	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
like 2700 K where it looked like an	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
they ' ve they ' ve been brought back not	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
no that ' s not how it works at the end of	41 41 41 41 41 49 50 41 41 41 41 41
the stage was to youtube hold on	71 71 71 71 71 79 71
For me in my business these nine different sources	40 40 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
after speaking with your lender and real	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
probably one hour but i just really	31 62 62 34 31 32 40
make the effort to learn the business of	71 71 71 71 70 70 70 71
there ' s a good chance against it can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because think about it we ' re only	67 68 41 41 40 40 40 40
apply what you ' ve learned where do you	70 79 71 71 71 71 70 70 70
so not looking like a supermodel can have its advantages as well	41 40 71 71 80 68 41 68 68 71 71 71
fulfillment because that ' s the way the	21 0 0 0 0 21 21 0
pretty much just as good quality like	67 49 49 71 71 71 70
youtube land you can check me out on	49 49 76 67 41 41 41 41
deleted scenes you may see me a few more	77 77 77 77 77 77 76 76 41
recommend looking at as many testing	49 40 40 40 40 40
I would ' ve been like oh I don ' t know	67 64 64 64 67 40 40 40 70 70 70 70
this will increase your awareness of all the life that ' s going on around you	41 41 41 71 71 71 70 70 70 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
depending on which country you ' re in (	61 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
optional though alright that ' s it	76 76 79 79 79 79 79

That is a lot it ' s like gone up	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 49 49 49
unfortunately in the real world there	49 49 70 70 41 79
these then you ' re gonna be spending a	79 79 71 71 71 71 71 71 70
that i think you should focus your work	50 50 50 50 50 50 81 80
to get a feel for the acting landscape	41 71 70 70 70 70 70 71
And so he set up this 10 year bet	64 67 67 67 40 49 76 76 70

between two people so that you can	44 41 41 41 40 40 40
something they start wallowing around in	70 79 79 49 49 19

who have built software businesses	49 49 49 49 49
