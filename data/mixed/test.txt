shared and spoiled on social media	71 71 71 71 71 50
people in there thinking	50 50 53 73
let ' s say a hundred dollars	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
and I don ' t want to lose all that my money	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so now let ' s go through an example of a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 71 71 71 71
down in one technician class	64 64 64 64 68
the description below one more thing	68 67 67 67 67 67
current score sorted out before you	79 79 79 79 79 79
overboard with a full blonde costume the	70 70 49 70 70 71 79
single week today we ' re talking about	0 41 71 71 71 71 67 70
certain number of jobs	71 50 50 50
products are the easiest way to save	70 70 40 70 70 43 70
But hypothetically if it did	52 52 52 52 52
atmosphere where i love this time of	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
that you are thinking about getting and	70 43 70 79 79 79 43
failure well every time you go to	49 41 41 41 41 41 41
now look these plays are not going to	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
the future so look at that neighborhood	79 79 79 79 79 79 19
but the more you expose yourself to other people	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
but it ' s the only thing that I ' ve done	40 40 40 40 41 41 40 41 40 40 40 40
think personally it ' s smart to having a	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 31 58
degree from college you would put	0 0 0 0 0 0
Sharon wrote a book called how to	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
if it ' s your first time here make sure	41 41 41 41 41 71 69 68 64 64
in movies and tv shows too when i worked	40 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
they simply mean to turn your body and	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
but in the comments of that video i got	79 79 79 79 71 71 71 71 71
I want to point out is that your	49 49 49 49 79 79 49 49
professional headshots	50 80
that are required in order to get your	52 49 52 53 53 53 43 71
This is like absolutely game	50 0 0 0 0
multiply that by let ' s say 0 . 4 and that	40 40 49 49 49 49 40 40 40 40 40 37
So maybe your house is worth close to 200 , 000 pounds	64 31 49 79 79 79 70 52 53 53 53 80
to have a pre - approval letter otherwise	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
just suit my schedule right we oh you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
in service to our future selves	53 79 52 49 67 70
gains with prices nearly doubling over	71 70 70 31 31 31
all this information needs to be at the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
opinion it ' s a lot easier the class	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67 67
off of commission so they charge a	68 41 68 68 71 49 49
to install a brand - new water heater and	0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0

it makes sense that we would get some kind of return	51 51 52 52 52 52 79 79 79 52 70
heard of that	71 50 50
see every way that they ask things	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
new and put yourself out there a little	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
by far been one of the best investments	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
I have two on how you can study for exams	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 50 49 49
studying computer science in college	79 79 79 79 79
don ' t take up their entire day you may	49 49 49 79 79 76 71 71 71 49

good my my career will go on you don	29 29 29 29 29 29 29 30 41
business can soar because you ' re not the	79 79 79 79 76 76 76 79 80
because money has no value	70 70 70 70 70

net income is a hundred thousand dollars	31 31 31 31 31 31 31
see what products you buy and instead of	76 40 70 79 71 80 43 52
And in fact a lot of huge YouTubers	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 41
your resume will not have a lot of stuff	71 71 79 79 52 79 79 79 79
buy rental property you can use cash you	31 31 31 31 32 31 31 32

and create your own courses platform	79 79 76 49 41 41
year stations with you and your copy of	68 68 41 71 71 71 71 71
union if it does cost more to go union	71 71 80 80 80 77 71 71 77
shortcut to making money online you	76 76 76 76 76 20
So if you wanted to make $ 100 a month from affiliates	70 49 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49
take this back to acting	68 68 68 71 71
food is there you know there are a lot	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
professionals they know what to do they	79 80 79 79 79 79 79
still getting a paycheck	40 67 70 49
up for success there are so many	71 71 71 53 53 53 52
and you ' re struggling to keep up with the workload	79 70 70 70 70 61 68 71 70 70 49
and just kind of do it consistently	70 79 79 76 64 65 77
scams unfortunately in a multi	71 79 80 80 71
going to be able to offer you for most	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79
sometimes independent films may pay a	50 41 40 40 40 41
not regrets uh if you like this video	76 79 79 79 76 76 79 79
which is again absolutely insane	52 70 70 70 70
to make up for the price that you ' re selling it for	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
uh they were not they were not told	41 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
this video because firstly more people	53 26 80 80 80 80
think it ' s not worth your time to	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
this means that in total you are	10 10 10 11 11 20 20
put in the work yes i ' m willing to work	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77
well in my opinion the number one	49 49 76 76 50 50 50
still a chance that you don ' t get cast	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 71
like actors access like casting networks	41 41 41 41 41 41
but it would be a lot harder for me to justify for a car	51 51 51 51 51 51 18 24 50 14 14 14 18 54
performers get residual	40 40 70
lie to you in that video all right let	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
they ' re broken up into three sections	70 70 70 52 52 52 70 79
get involved in acting in school because	67 67 67 67 71 79 79
there are also other services like Betterment	67 70 70 49 49 79 80
and once you ' re making $ 100 a month from it	55 28 28 28 28 31 55 55 55 64 64 73
like probability number theory algorithms	61 70 70 70 49
maybe it says	52 79 52
many casting directors will hold	79 76 79 76 70
if you have an s corp which i definitely	40 40 31 31 31 31 31 31 31

attention on your face at all times so I	41 49 49 40 49 49 49 41 41
that you can find people to pay you for	52 52 52 50 49 49 49 25 50
" it ' s gonna be bad and it ' s gonna be wrong	52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 79

they ' re gonna be on your side with a	46 46 46 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
head shot because in this step of the	71 71 49 49 49 52 79 79
to fill no single day is alike some days	40 40 40 67 67 67 58 58 70

productivity course you ' ve got this	21 21 21 21 21 21 21

And I know that inflation is a thing	76 76 49 71 71 71 71 71
not work on your acting i ' m just saying	50 50 50 53 80 53 53 53 50 50
square footage of your home office	28 31 28 31 31 31

commercials and it even happens	41 31 31 31 31
you ' re gonna have a lot of experience	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67
and let ' s say the director was greg	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
And I think last month she ' s just passed	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
city I can tell you right now that the	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 79 79
your first rental or investment property	31 40 44 40 70 67

group needs someone to bring them together and and be okay	80 80 50 41 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
and remember to ask your questions down	67 67 41 41 41 41 41
are sometimes thousands of people that	79 76 76 79 79 79
and then that ' s something that I think	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
lot of	67 67
very big on mobility and resiliency in	41 41 41 41 50 41 41
they represent another actor	80 54 80 79
many many other things that could go	49 49 49 49 67 71 71
want it leaked right they don ' t want it	70 70 67 67 64 64 64 64 67 67
with your employment is look at your	41 40 40 40 40 40 40
so that you can learn that acting is not	40 40 49 67 40 49 49 79 43
mean I was definitely caught off guard a	49 49 49 49 40 40 41 50
stuff and they ' re gonna get you a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
really hard to make that move to the us	71 80 80 80 80 80 77 77 77
people are scared but you definitely	52 49 49 40 40 40
a great place to start is to search for	71 71 71 71 71 71 68 68 71
And that leads to a new metric	79 79 79 79 79 79 61
learned had to do with my audition when	41 41 41 41 41 41 44 49
especially when you consider the fact	70 79 79 79 79 79

you get to kind of what feels like the end game	31 32 32 32 32 31 1 1 1 2 2
month or two and then has to move back	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40

every day	67 70
places that you know I might not focus	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49

your time and energy on it number three	79 79 79 79 79 79 52 52

about how I self tape my auditions I	71 71 71 71 71 49 49 49

And it would be a shame	77 77 77 77 70 79
Now this is very relevant to Tesla discussion	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

And actually a lot of people would extend that to 10 years	70 70 70 70 70 49 49 79 52 49 79 79
from my audience decided to invest in my Gringotts fund	70 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then another thing you need to think	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you yes you have to do this in your	79 73 73 77 77 80 80 80 80
this role of george because we had seen	79 79 79 51 51 79 76 76
you can watch all five hours of this class	49 79 79 49 49 49 49 49 49
but chances are you ' ve not really heard	50 49 49 40 40 40 49 76 49
resume is not named something like	77 77 77 79 79 79
because when i got my first audition i	77 71 71 71 71 71 53 44
awesome investment	79 79
and they ' re sitting in a savings account	61 58 58 58 58 58 58 67 40
FHA loan this is a loan that ' s issued by	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71
the actor will make a percentage of that	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
before getting onto a big	79 79 79 79 79
leads to another on this flywheel	76 76 76 67 40 40
ready to become	77 80 80
totally okay to keep it that way	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
or filming something or trying to learn something	70 70 79 70 70 79 79 70
Idea number seven for passive income	49 49 41 40 41 40
because there is really no such thing as passive income	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 49 49 70
reasons why i think atlanta is the best	70 40 70 70 70 67 67 67
book the room in an audition your	80 77 77 80 80 76 77
is not monetary the real cost	71 67 71 71 71 71
and now we have time to get ready for	49 79 79 79 49 70 71 71 71
just having this swinging down by my	70 70 43 43 70 70 43
so avoid them at all costs agents and	80 79 79 79 79 40 70 70

boring audition after boring audition if	40 53 53 80 71 41
Stanislavski Stella Adler Chekhov the	71 68 71 71 41
attached to its and word olympic trend mil	40 40 70 70 70 70 68 68
and it ' s very hard but it ' s a lot of fun	49 40 40 40 46 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 76 79
be that that big like there ' s a load of	41 41 41 41 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to create your demo reel for you	49 49 41 41 41 71 71
that my sister and I went through as we	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
where the film and television production	71 71 71 71 71 50
we do this in real life because we don	37 49 49 41 41 41 49 49 49
laminate or a luxury vinyl these are	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and remember at the end of the day being	79 79 71 71 80 80 80 79 79
this project wouldn ' t have happened	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
not only learning new content but when i	49 49 79 79 79 49 49 79
look really great but they ' re gonna be a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
club national and Olympic levels	50 49 70 80 79
And in this video I wanna talk about	52 70 40 53 71 68 77 76
share with everybody be it a book or a	46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46
So for example if you happen to own 1 % of Apple	31 58 61 79 79 70 70 70 70 70 70 61
another administrative assistant so	79 79 79 79
that feel worth pursuing	76 76 68 67
to commercials they	50 50 49
you know	53 53
health sleep health your fitness health	49 50 50 49 50 50
do I go take a more traditional	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you to do it because	79 79 79 79 79
go in person to a classroom and in my	40 67 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
And there ' s a great phrase	49 49 49 49 76 76 41
acting career all right that is it for	71 49 49 41 41 41 41 41
payment is going to come out to around	19 11 20 20 11 10 10 11
And she started this when was it in the summer of 2019	49 49 79 76 76 79 76 76 76 76 76 76
also i want you guys to think outside	79 49 49 79 79 49 79 80
you can teach the thing and I think a	76 76 76 76 76 40 40 67 53
my name is kurt yu thank you so much for	41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71 79 79
in fact i just switched insurance	40 41 67 70 79 79
another factor that can either help or	77 41 41 41 41 41 41
content give it a thumbs up and remember	53 71 71 71 71 68 68 68
today is because you can watch	71 71 71 71 71 71
for a bank account	71 71 70 31
actor then you believe that any money	80 80 80 80 80 80 80
but also potentially in residuals years	68 40 37 67 67 67
the hedonism the pure unadulterated joy type of fun	71 71 49 79 79 79 64 64 64
it ' s really important to know the	40 40 40 40 40 37 37 40
looks like	40 40
make 130	40 32
submit for an audition uh casting	67 67 67 70 70 70
right before we move on I think it	79 79 79 76 71 70 70 71
but how hard is it to make $ 100 a month	62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62
need anything close to 20 % when you	79 70 79 79 79 79 79 79
this is where i want to make a	41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71
agent ' s experience comes into play and	80 80 80 80 70 70 70 70
And let ' s say your average conversion rate	41 41 41 41 41 40 49 49 41
every single workout and it ' s just not	50 49 50 50 49 49 49 49 49
casting websites	50 79
now that the casting director has	70 70 70 40 40 40
payment and you can actually just	1 1 1 1 1 1
sell as digital stuff because you	-29 -29 0 0 0 0
they decided to open up the role to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
for Skillshare with your affiliate link thing	50 50 50 31 31 40 49
non - union productions	72 72 72 67
shoots team everything with her profession in	49 71 71 71 71 71 71
important role so using a prop in your	41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40
do your paint	31 19 0
Then once you ' ve made your account	68 64 70 70 70 67 67 50
you know there ' s a variety in there you	22 37 37 37 37 50 50 50 50 38
even though gains compound losses compound as well	79 71 71 70 49 49 49 49
was thinking about buying these nano	41 41 0 0 0 0
and it ' s quite hard to make a business	70 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 79 79
real estate investing it ' s already a	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
So we ' re gonna give this a three out of five stars	49 49 49 49 40 41 40 40 49 40 37 76 76
that you want to buy a house and are	49 49 68 68 68 71 71 76 68
I like to add an activity now while I	50 50 50 53 53 53 67 67 67
years ago i think it was for the nba	37 67 68 41 41 41 41 41 68
could spread the word and tell people	49 41 71 71 71 71 71
idea what had happened	49 49 49 49
reviewed my previous audition and my	40 40 67 67 70 40
spending some time here with me today on	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
you will basically	40 40 50
have to study and pass this test so the	71 70 0 0 0 71 71 71 79
with their emotions and on impulse	40 40 40 31 31 40
even if it ' s indirectly they may not	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
working a full - time job and i needed to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
not account for	31 31 31
take 2 take 3 it ' s the same thing at	67 70 71 71 49 49 49 49 79 80 70
definitely a misconception because	49 49 40 41
first real estate investment property	79 80 71 71 70
it ' s a TV set and we ' re a recurring	19 19 19 41 46 46 50 50 50 50 50 50
the first time i was an extra in a	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 64 64
because of some reason that is	79 79 79 79 79 79
earning 0 . 01 % interest	49 41 41 41 41 49
information they ' re going to work with	79 79 79 79 79 80 70 61
studio you would put	0 0 0 0
can add up to	70 67 67 67
load of materials that teach you the ins	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
in all of the companies in the index	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
you may want to consider not doing	71 68 41 41 50 81 81
a drama club or doesn ' t have school	40 49 50 50 49 49 49 49 49
online course and that ' s actually what I	41 41 40 49 49 49 40 40 40
through middle school through high	0 0 0 0 0
into the film and television industry	0 0 0 0 0 0
happens and	70 70
And so your house will probably be worth	70 49 49 70 79 50 54 53
down to what are my goals what am I	19 19 41 41 50 50 19 19 19
now a home inspection generally costs	53 53 53 53 41 41
So let ' s talk about that now	51 51 51 51 51 50 50 50
curls you ' re literally tearing the	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
sees of you so it ' s very important to	80 77 77 77 52 52 52 70 67 68
driving by	47 41
then using the actual expenses method is	40 37 40 40 31 31 40
and just all other sorts of stuff	70 52 52 52 52 52 52
to actually make money from YouTube	49 49 49 40 40 40
about things	80 80
Is it related to how many views or how many subscribers	67 67 67 68 68 68 68 68 68 67 67
gonna have the freedom to heck of time	46 46 46 46 40 37 37 49
so how do we do that and that ' s where	52 52 52 25 25 52 70 70 70 70 50
and the network for a movie	70 70 79 80 79 79
not the case here in atlanta	49 70 70 40 40 70
as you progress in your career you might	79 76 73 73 73 73 73 73
so today let ' s talk about exactly how	77 41 41 41 41 71 71 49 52
So throughout 2019 the rate bumps up a bit	49 40 49 49 49 49 40 49 49
first line my first line here is a few	69 77 77 76 76 76 77 69 69
already know you ' re an actor they have	68 68 71 71 71 71 71 71 49
to put 20 % down if there were no loan	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 61
percent fica on that forty thousand	31 31 31 40 40 31
auditioned for other roles on cobra kai	53 80 80 80 80 53 53
world and they ' ll still	70 68 68 68 68 77
that I didn ' t have to film a video that evening	67 64 64 64 64 64 67 64 64 67 67 67
or you can hire a property manager to do	40 40 40 49 49 49 49 40 40
what might come up right just in case	49 49 49 49 49 50 49 40
on your computer digital headshots are	0 0 0 0 71 71
if you are submitting your acting resume	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I felt like I needed to show a connection with my scene partner	71 70 44 68 71 44 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
the sustainability of our animals and so	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
into your account	41 41 71
to forceps then the starch they can go and of	80 80 80 50 80 50 81 80 80 80
a shoot or something on the weekends but	37 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
of the value of the money in our savings account	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
your credit score and i have this first	52 52 52 40 40 40 40 40
and give it a thumbs up we ' ll see you next time go get him this week	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
own children and they ' re under 18 years	70 70 40 40 40 40 76 76 67
all of those credits onto your acting	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
auditioning and career advice every	71 71 71 41 79
there and says uh hi uh my name is John	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
but before we get started i just want to	68 68 67 68 68 68 67 71 71
Yeah this was a special video	0 0 0 0 42 42
cheat sheet and it ' s my actual	40 40 40 40 40 40 49 49
same folder and now it ' s done then we	23 41 41 41 41 41 41 42 42 41
26 i didn ' t do any acting before i was	79 79 79 79 79 79 52 79 79 79 79
that are making passive income	49 49 49 49 49
theater in their past	79 79 79 79
audition so if there ' s a TV on in the	71 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26
day it has to be sustainable or the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
thousands of dollars what i recommend is	53 53 53 40 52 80 53
cost money up front that ' s one thing	49 52 49 49 41 41 41 49 49
lines I lines simply refers to where	62 59 71 70 68 71 71
from that audition	71 71 71
if you put background work on your	49 79 79 79 79 79 79
result in performance what i recommend	79 79 79 79 79 79
side so	40 79
so make sure that you have training that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for a lifetime or a lifestyle not just	41 41 40 40 40 40 41 41
they have no idea how the business works	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
because podcasts themselves don ' t really have an algorithm	43 79 79 70 70 70 67 76 76 67
multiple times because selling digital products	58 58 58 46 49 19
life purpose	1 1
understanding this concept is really	44 70 70 31 61
first speaking role in a major movie as	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 67
but i ' m excited to see	79 70 70 70 70 70 70
thousands of people buy those dvds it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
example through real estate express	41 41 40 50 50
someone has told us something similar	79 79 79 79 79 79
won ' t look that great in five days this	70 70 70 71 41 70 71 71 41 49
my own agent has said that when she gets	77 77 77 80 80 77 77 77 77
rather than videos that were uploaded this month	49 49 49 67 67 67 67 58
you want to become a real estate	67 67 31 31 31 31 32
to get out of pain faster I recover	49 49 49 49 22 49 19 19
taping let ' s get right to it	71 71 71 71 64 67 67 67
but if you can actually use that car	40 40 40 40 37 31 31 31
or a tv show whatever it is then you do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
brings a smile to my face and I I just	68 68 68 68 68 68 68 49 49 52
personal trainer yeah yeah you know I	49 49 49 50 50 50 50
with the item so if you have items like	31 31 31 41 41 41 40 40 40
At that point if you decide to sell your house	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 73 73
going to have three units that you can	20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
abilities because of my unique talents	79 76 79 79 79 79
and now you have to go try to scrap and	79 52 52 79 52 79 79 79 79 79
information useful and leave me a	71 71 71 49 71 71
And if people buy the product through your link	41 40 40 67 67 68 58 58 58
something comes up you have some extra	44 68 68 68 67 70 68
let ' s say 300 megabits per second and	40 40 40 80 81 70 70 70 70
having systems in place and streamlining	79 79 79 79 79 79
scene over again sometimes they will	79 76 44 71 79 71
go to a professional headshot	41 41 41 41 41
you aren ' t booking jobs from them then	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 68 76
are gonna target that particular audience	71 71 71 71 71 71
then give them your financial	79 79 79 79 79
you don ' t want to make going	70 70 70 70 40 40 40 71
not be able to do those things	80 68 40 40 40 70 49
want to get it to the point where	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 49
Now you ' ve lost a lot of money	31 1 1 1 31 31 31 31 67
the model for that is that a jab it	49 77 77 77 77 77 77 76 77
How to do it on	80 50 71 71 71
are made in the same factories as the	43 61 61 70 70 71 71 80
the fast food	49 49 49
to work out the actual inflation - adjusted returns for that	58 58 55 58 58 58 58 58 61 61 61
this will never happen because that ' s just way too high	0 50 52 80 51 51 51 51 51 51 78 54
because different areas have	43 34 34 43
to submit for this audition	67 67 71 71 67
look professional that speaks to how	71 71 71 71 71 71
just such a cool thing to think about	71 70 71 71 71 71 71 71
even though that video had a lot of views	71 71 71 71 68 67 68 67 67
and by the way this example resume that	41 41 68 77 77 67 67 40
should actually be before finding a real	40 31 41 31 31 32 32
kind of at that point where you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
having a strong pre - approval letter that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
is if you buy a stock at a certain price	50 49 80 79 79 49 22 49 67 67
whole tour hope guys like seeing the	43 43 43 16 49 13 79
to my channel to see more content just	41 41 49 49 49 41 41 41
that I learned and	62 70 70 79
self - taping setup for home	68 68 68 68 68 68

years to get an accepted offer depending	52 52 52 44 71 53 80
in the industry is by doing	41 41 49 49 50 71
you ' re not trying to juggle all of these	79 79 79 71 80 79 80 50 49 49
some point where the description of the	79 79 79 79 79 52 79
that and the mastermind because it was	70 70 71 79 79 70 79
which means that Amazon	64 64 64 64
now one more website that is very	53 53 44 43 70 79 43
they ' re not being left out of the loop	49 49 49 50 49 49 49 49 49 49
little bit cool it ' s again what you are	41 41 41 50 50 50 50 50 41 50
license to have because you ' re going to	79 79 79 70 76 76 76 61 61

you ' re like me and you don ' t like cold	79 79 79 79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
so learn how to audition learn how to	70 70 70 70 70 70 80 80
every single penny that you have	40 31 40 40 40 40
that particular role but it ' s also an	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
and the reason I brought up the long	46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46

and just putting some money in	0 0 0 0 0 0
and on this channel we explore the	71 71 71 71 71 80 53
that has helped me to this very day	71 44 41 41 71 71 71 49
paperwork to store because everything is	70 71 70 70 79 79
we ' re going to talk about all of those	77 77 77 77 77 77 71 71 71 71
business decision but remember this	70 80 41 41 41
reason for that is because	70 70 70 79 70

because the way podcasters make money	41 49 49 49 41 41

Thirdly I came across this idea of	49 49 49 49 49 79 49
of moving the body around you know with	49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50
You just sought out the rental management	67 67 67 49 49 49 49
talking about sag	53 50 79
an agent is to follow agents and casting	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
basically what that means is when you	70 70 70 70 79 79 70
business just as a whole	79 79 79 79 79
the voice recorder app on my phone and	52 44 43 43 40 40 40 40
it I I had it and it was gonna be for	46 46 49 49 49 49 46 46 46 46 46
you can find these opportunities because	40 41 41 41 50 50
flooring don ' t cheap out don ' t get the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
one i would recommend everybody watch it	49 49 49 49 49 76 76
and investing that money and if you	46 40 41 41 70 40 40
would write supporting and	0 0 0 0
and it always seems to be the case that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
those steps okay so let ' s start with an	71 71 41 44 44 44 44 71 71 71
a producer i ' m not an agent i ' m not a	40 49 80 80 80 80 80 41 68 68 68 71 71
if you ' re one of those Android heathens	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
take advantage of all the other things	77 80 80 49 52 52 49
for the next 10 years	43 71 71 80 41
this whole investment thing	79 79 79 79
preparation process that ' s helped me	41 41 41 41 41 76 79
who like to wear purple suits and have a	49 49 49 49 79 49 49 40 49
whenever you have some free time a	79 70 70 70 70 70 70
say you ' re on on a job and you ' re in the	40 41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
So three of them are on productivity	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
find you then well you are going to be	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
but that begs the question of	40 40 67 67 70 70
rockstar actor and you already booked	68 40 40 40 40 40
selling services as a web and graphic	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
reduce every single word in the script	40 40 70 70 70 70 70
ebooks have erased the necessity to have	40 40 70 61 61 70 70
these are longterm investments	24 40 40 40
Anyway let ' s get into the video	11 20 20 20 79 79 79 79
character the third column in the	0 0 0 0 0 0
over the country this is why I said	79 71 71 71 79 79 79 79
It ' s more about the skills that you gain	52 52 52 52 52 43 43 52 52 43
that you should definitely read	71 79 79 67 73
within show it so show it is the website	67 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
business as an actor	76 76 80 79
that put way too much emphasis on	71 41 50 80 80 80 50
in the short term	67 40 49 49
it ' s your first time here make sure to	41 41 41 49 49 49 49 40 40 41
are impulsive and when you look at	53 41 40 49 49 49 49
a mentor like that since i know it can	61 61 61 61 79 79 71 79 79
the crowd	80 80
It ' s probably not enough for a house	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
many of these workshops will give the	79 79 49 41 41 71 71
So this will vary massively	52 52 79 79 79
what ' s going on but then when they	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80 80
get is like do I take an online class or	70 70 79 79 70 79 70 0 0 0
But then very quickly you realize	76 67 70 70 70 70
basically start with whatever you can	70 70 70 70 70 70
their categories there are literally	0 0 0 0 0
He said that hedge funds are a bit pointless	70 70 71 71 67 67 67 49 67
compare that to the	20 11 11 11

back which I greatly appreciated but	41 41 49 49 49 49
today ' s appliances are generally	79 79 79 79 80 80
around how do we figure out what ' s meaningful to us	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
to audition	50 50
here ' s an example	71 71 71 71 71
photographer has to come out twice and	79 79 76 76 79 79 79
which movie it is it ' ll just say	68 41 41 41 40 40 40 40 41
actually only ends up costing my business 40	76 76 76 49 49 49 49 50
and outs	80 80
we ' re in the middle of the pandemic so	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 68
and people would probably usually see a five - second ad	67 67 67 67 67 67 41 41 41 41 40
individual can find auditions off of	40 40 40 40 40 40
in this hypothetical 10 % interest savings account	79 71 71 31 31 31 31 70
well it ' s possible to be not	71 71 71 71 79 79 79 40
but guess what that ' s what everybody is	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 79 70
them out of your sole proprietorship	43 79 52 52 43 43
and invitations to maybe 50 or 100	79 80 80 80 80 79 79
your article we are going to such the	76 76 76 71 41 71 71 71
audition for the role are gonna talk	68 68 68 68 67 71 61
probably heard a lot of people	79 79 79 79 79 79
studios that you could take classes	41 40 40 40 40 40
on your net worth and again make sure to	44 71 41 49 23 23 50 41 41
have the sides and I said what my my	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
research those on your own but as far as	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
they ' re you know their food sources are	28 28 28 28 37 28 28 40 32
houses before so I do have some	1 79 79 79 79 79 79
roll camera roll sound and meanwhile	73 73 73 73 22 23
want to get to level to level to make	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76
is anything that has more than one step required to do it	40 67 70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
thing I can ' t afford to buy a home	70 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70
but you have to know which ones have the	40 40 70 70 40 70 49 80 80
acting studio	41 71
you make the videos the recorded video	46 40 46 46 49 49 49
to renovate it	20 20 20
others so now i ' m going to take you guys	21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21
in purely passive income	41 50 49 49
goods or digital product now a digital	49 49 49 11 11 11 11
is such a powerful thing	81 81 81 49 40
an acting career	70 71 71
hey Amazon grew 10X in the last 10 years	49 43 49 49 49 49 70 70 70
educators versus just um you know the	80 80 80 79 79 79 79
and you don ' t book any of them and	41 41 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
prior but instead of again instead of	41 41 37 37 43 37 43
perfect for and we ' d like to book you	76 76 76 76 76 76 77 77 79 79
go attend a conference visit a client or	31 31 31 28 31 31 31 40
about booking the room	71 71 71 49
think about it a TV show or a movie is	71 71 71 41 41 68 71 71 71 71
in your small business i feel like this	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
deposit 100 or more and those four free	41 40 40 40 41 14 14 41
And it really doesn ' t seem like it would do that	70 70 67 67 67 67 67 70 79 76 73 76
for a movie and television show	52 79 79 71 71 71
well you mentioned results and it ' s you	41 41 41 41 32 32 32 32 32
finance I make videos about this every	71 70 70 61 61 61 70
probably won ' t have any television or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
guys to try and do is attach a monthly	49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
film and television production markets	70 70 70 70 53
earlier this year and i didn ' t book it	79 79 79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
digital products and sales funnels and	79 79 79 79 79 71
house hacking you can live in a house or	70 70 70 70 71 70 79 79 62
in the right ways so let ' s get started	31 31 31 31 13 13 13 13 40 40
commercials as well	40 40 70
the acting career center here to help	71 71 71 71 67 64 64
get that going so if you will be sure to	40 41 41 41 49 44 53 53 53 53
make sure to rate shop with different	31 40 40 40 67 67 40
physical stuff but obviously I think	76 76 76 76 46 19
agent now the last thing i want to	41 67 67 67 70 70 70 70
amount of money that they are able to	79 79 79 79 70 79 79 79
place so right now i do have	43 52 52 52 71 71 79
w - 2 salary but the rest of the money	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
has a thousand or more questions that	40 40 40 41 41 41 41
do i regret moving to atlanta instead of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you don ' t have to get a full workout in	46 49 49 49 49 40 46 46 40 46 49
read and you follow those taping	70 70 67 70 70 70
an individual activity that is	71 71 67 67 67
don ' t have to follow any of those rules	67 67 67 67 67 49 68 68 71 71
because you ' re gonna be acting in a way	61 61 61 61 62 62 61 61 62 62
you say it that ' s why I like to talk	68 68 70 68 68 68 68 68 77 77 77
basically every time that a production	50 41 71 52 50 80
in this side hustle assessment matrix	71 79 22 49 49 50
now in addition to on stage experience	49 41 41 41 43 40 41
but even just think about other	25 53 53 53 53 53
huge depreciations and actually lose	70 31 67 19 19
There are other sources of passive income	59 58 58 58 58 58 58
one day and go	49 49 49 49
spending a lot more money than we really	52 79 79 52 52 79 79 79
one of the best licenses to get but	76 76 70 79 79 79 79 79
publicly posted publicly as well on	50 44 53 50 71 80
how to do it and all of that so i	49 49 49 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
you are taking your career now i know	71 71 71 80 71 71 71 71
to see you	71 71 71
that ' s because i ' ve been pretty busy i	71 71 71 79 52 52 52 76 43 41 41
acting goals are	71 71 41
And so for me every time I ' m writing	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
but really this is absolutely going to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
all these other actors who did provide	80 53 53 53 81 81 80
you run around me really fast and do	46 75 73 73 73 73 73 76
drop shipping January focuses on	40 37 64 64 40
that ' s not how it works	49 49 49 49 49 76 79
faster and I ' m able to get stronger and	46 19 19 19 19 49 49 49 49 49
no agent no headshot no resume you	76 70 67 70 67 71 41
better from a nutrient density	41 41 41 41 41
those are the lines that your character	77 80 80 80 80 80 80
and learn how to code and so if you	80 80 71 68 68 71 71 49 49
It ' s because YouTube takes a cut	19 19 19 19 0 70 70 70
more classy looking I think these days	49 79 79 79 79 79 79
all over the world and there ' s no way i	41 41 41 41 41 50 50 50 50 49 40
needs to be about 500 those are	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
cheaper and	71 71
my experience	68 80
which sometimes takes a few days	64 67 55 58 31 31
to get here	70 67 71
taking acting classes	41 71 71
I ' m sure you have as well to have a good	41 41 41 41 44 44 71 71 71 71 41 41
for example one of my good friends when	79 79 79 79 80 79 79 79
Therefore they ' re a lot less likely to watch	67 70 70 70 61 67 67 67 67 67
know any local actor that they have	50 41 77 40 68 68 71
an audition	71 71
000 after that it drops down to 2	67 40 40 40 49 49 40 31
episode 12 prior to that it had already	70 71 68 68 68 69 69 69
the master bedroom and then the other	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
myself a different deadline than the	77 77 77 76 79 79
creativity and potential revenue and	79 79 79 79 79
instances where that has happened before	79 79 79 80 80 79
but when we have a script we already know all of our lines so it ' s easy	41 41 40 40 40 40 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 40 49 49 49 40
during that conversation she	37 41 41 41
no actor starts their career by being a	70 70 67 70 67 64 64 64
monologues are used quite a bit but i	67 76 67 67 67 71 41 50
license later on or eventually become a	0 0 0 0 79 79 79
money back see i do refer to this as a	40 71 40 40 40 41 40 41 41 40
audition preparation process that	79 79 52 52
things that i am really gifted at that	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
But point number six is how the hell do you buy a share	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 52 52
self - helpy but actually it ' s it ' s a very	52 52 52 70 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
my current demo reel you can go to my	67 67 67 67 68 41 41 41 68
youtube i can literally go on a trip and	31 31 1 1 31 31 31 31 31
like online brokerages that don ' t take	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
right so when you are a recurring	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you ' re interested in learning more about	67 67 67 40 40 40 40 40
a handy tool I like to call the internet	68 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 68
work for me and there is another big	44 71 71 76 76 76 76 76
at the end of the day regardless because	32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
and spreads that payment over months and	61 61 61 62 70 70 40
audition for the casting director	79 79 49 41 71
and not very inviting I ' m not gonna	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and I ordered it online which was a very nice experience	31 31 31 31 67 31 31 0 0 0 0
and i know there are going to be a lot	40 40 40 40 40 49 49 49 52 52
that movie and i look for my scenes and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
don ' t know when that ' s going to happen	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
please don ' t quit please don ' t give up	80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
great way to get started	50 50 50 50 50
television shows and you ' re wondering	49 52 79 52 52 52 41
there are many great brokerages out	79 79 79 79 79 79
so if you happen to have the skill or	67 41 41 41 70 67 67 71 40
casting director	76 73
you must join sag	71 71 71 68
i ' m too old to be doing this i ' m not	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
different ways that actors make money	49 49 49 49 49 49
like tunnel vision focused on i want to	76 73 79 76 79 79 79 79
every week about human physiology	67 70 70 70 70
changed as well	79 79 79
Link in the video description	43 79 76 52 49
dreams of newbie actors who haven ' t done	79 79 71 71 70 70 70 70 70
" or think at some point	71 71 71 71 71 71
why a demo reel is so important for	77 77 77 77 77 77 50 41
closes all right the seventh and final	43 50 50 41 41 80 71
So you can ' t start monetizing	41 41 49 49 49 49 71
guess what it ' s also possible to be too	77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77 77 51
it ' s very very easy to start a podcast	50 50 50 50 50 49 76 76 76 49
I ' ll tell you about the sponsor segment later	58 58 58 55 58 58 58 58 58 58
unfortunately it ' s not that simple	52 71 71 71 79 79 77
maybe uh an extra day but	71 70 70 70 68 71
put up so	0 0 0
with them and any payments done on that	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
and the iPad video has made 2 , 246 pounds	61 61 58 58 58 59 60 60 60 60
books and today we ' re talking about	70 67 64 64 64 64 64 64
safety protocols that ' s dictated by the	50 50 50 50 50 50 41 68
put down at least 25 percent and it	31 31 31 40 40 67 67 31
so I ' m I ' m more like Steven Seagal ' s	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you know the unexpected things might	79 79 79 79 79 79

in an uncertain world	1 1 1 1
estate practice and your real estate	0 0 0 0 0 0
property three hundred thousand dollars	0 0 0 0 0
important decision	71 68
Point number two is that	67 67 67 76 76
I ' ve lived in Atlanta for a few years	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
They ' ve got thousands of classes	55 55 55 55 55 55 55
the point is that non - union productions	40 40 43 40 40 40 40 40
the casting director might say hey let	79 79 79 67 67 68 64
know that they can trust you to go on to	76 76 77 77 77 77 77 73 73 73
so you know he ' s a huge huge celebrity	49 76 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 68
there ' s also an annual mortgage	70 70 70 79 0 0 0
in mind what i think about all the time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that you read is called profit first and	80 79 79 80 79 79 79 79
and i kind of just hit the ground	76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
definitely have	41 40
important i think that ' s something that	79 49 76 79 79 79 79 79

48 dollars per year	49 68 68 71
you want to start self taping your	80 49 49 49 49 71 71
improvement product and as I walked into	79 79 71 41 41 50 41
It ' s all just very mundane	71 71 71 71 71 77 41
what we ' re saying as actors though we need to make	71 71 71 71 71 41 41 41 40 41 41 41
industry and that ' s how I approach what	79 79 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
oh my gosh i ' m stepping stones into	79 79 49 49 49 49 79 79 79

luxurious if you ' re doing a rental you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
correct answer which will lead to better	49 49 49 49 49 49 49
could be so completely wrecked	62 62 76 70 70
going to put in the work	67 67 67 67 67 67
actors can only work on union	71 77 40 40 40 40
deliver the best audition you possibly	76 79 76 79 79 79
Now the problem is that when you are very small on YouTube	49 49 40 40 50 50 40 49 40 40 40 49
in those situations is just work on	41 41 41 50 50 41 41

could be doing dishes	50 77 49 37
don ' t have to follow	40 40 40 67 67 67
as a working actor in the industry i	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49

there that let you buy homes it much	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

list goes on and on so there ' s always	71 70 71 71 71 71 70 70 70 70
process that I use that has helped me	41 41 49 49 40 49 49 49
breakdowns they will then take those	71 37 37 40 40 40
there ' s and there ' s nothing wrong with	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 40 40 50

service go through and memorize the	50 40 49 49 40 40
story so props are not the main focus of	79 79 70 40 49 40 70 67 70
all the time and a lot of novice actors	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
imdb or it ' s just a video on youtube	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
the idea of becoming rich and famous	49 50 50 49 49 41 41

on Facebook groups so lots of realtor	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to get to the point where the casting	79 79 79 76 73 76 76 76
that you think you might need to use	67 70 71 71 70 70 70 49

the same it ' s gonna save you at least a	70 70 70 70 70 43 52 79 70 70 79
involved in the commercial well	41 49 49 49 41
side closer to three months if you	79 79 80 80 80 80 80
because i do think there is such a thing	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 68 68
luckily i had a good enough score to do	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
like internally I ' m fighting myself and	32 32 32 32 32 33 33 33
accelerated schedule	31 31
the wrong size paper it conveys the	79 79 79 52 49 43 52
high level	49 49
the last one on this list	71 71 31 31 31 71
anymore to say all the lines now you	40 43 40 40 40 40 40 70
And if you look at the performance	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
thing for a few years but I realized	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
three days later	44 44 44
needlessly big and luxurious homes	79 70 70 79 79
an administrative assistant	79 41 71
better now if you ' re interested in	71 79 79 79 79 79 41 41
it ' s very unlikely someone with no	68 68 68 41 49 50 50 49
are thousands of people competing for a	79 79 79 79 76 76 76
that I had ages ago that I wrote down on this project list	41 41 41 37 37 37 37 40 40 46 37 40 40
sign up for auto pay all right number 12	79 79 71 40 40 70 70 40 40
actual commercial credits on your acting	0 0 0 0 0 0
and yes that ' s where a lot of production	50 50 76 76 76 76 76 49 77 80
whatever right this could happen to you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
you will get 30 % of the premium membership	19 19 50 49 49 50 19 19 19
free audit cheat sheet that you can	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
ask the actors to improvise some	79 79 79 79 79 79
rent and you can do this by looking on	49 40 40 40 40 40 41 41 40
and in my opinion far outweigh those	41 71 71 71 71 71 71
and I hope someday it ' ll go well	52 52 52 79 79 79 79 79 52
but that ' s only been the past few years	49 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
figuring out and doing you know no	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
african - american or i ' m not caucasian or	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 25 52
so if you want to hear some of my	40 76 67 43 43 43 43 43 40
wasted time second is	41 14 14 11
on social media a lot of times they	70 41 41 50 53 80 50 49
and you don ' t even need to have a fancy - ass desk	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 0 0 0 0 0
anything this next one is kind of an	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
for television shows or movies that	49 49 49 40 41 77
later on and lastly you have to know	61 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
about coffee this is where we have	79 79 79 79 52 52 76
big deal because you are that much	79 76 73 73 73 73 73
the audition room and you ' re drawing a	19 19 49 49 49 49 49 49 19
and you absolutely can and should ignore the sunk costs	68 41 71 71 71 71 71 79 79 79
unlivable basement and then add a	70 70 79 79 79 76
sale like there ' s a really good review	53 53 80 80 80 71 71 71 53
look up that particular department and	23 50 50 41 41 41
the perfect job for you you are able to	49 41 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
to go into the office every day from	40 31 31 31 31 31 67 67
only elevated my business as a whole and	79 79 80 49 79 79 79 79
So I had some friends who I had like five friends	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
toilets range from maybe a hundred bucks	79 79 79 79 79 61 61
auditioning and career advice every week	77 77 77 80 80 80
whenever that deal is struck so let me	50 77 77 68 71 67 67 41
and have everybody read for that role	52 79 79 79 79 52 52
and not only look for	31 40 40 40 40
Like it doesn ' t matter	79 70 79 79 79 52
So when I was at university I made a website	50 50 40 40 40 40 31 31 49 49
sending those things out all the time so	77 49 52 49 49 52 52 79
because i don ' t have any full - time w - 2	52 52 79 79 79 79 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
and the point that this guy makes in his paper	76 76 73 73 40 40 40 67 40 40
enthusiastic and passionate about your	79 79 79 79 79
that will hopefully help you in your	41 71 41 41 41 71 71
just work as a salesperson you ' ll want	40 40 70 70 70 71 71 71 43
I still put in time and effort to thinking okay	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that it always takes a very long time to get going	26 53 26 53 53 53 68 60 63 63 63

28 as i continue to	79 79 79 79 79
all sorts of things within those categories	70 61 70 70 67 70 70
spectrum and if your credit score is a	71 79 70 70 70 70 70 70

in real estate investing and to do that	40 67 70 71 52 71 71 71

table in that	79 79 79
you through everything allowing you to	79 79 79 79 70 79
in my opinion when you weigh all the	49 40 50 77 50 67 77 80

where they say this is the best or this	47 38 41 42 42 41 41 41 41
Just because I then have this default activity	70 67 70 70 70 70 70 70

where Buffett said that he was gonna bet	80 79 76 40 70 70 70 67

But I thought it was a very interesting read	49 49 49 49 49 76 76 76 76
i mean why put that burden on a brand	50 50 50 50 50 50 49 49 49

Equally the only way to really lose money in stocks	79 79 79 79 79 49 49 79 70 70
the last 13 years like I started off	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

are the best acting teachers in	76 76 67 67 67 67
means that you literally get to live for	19 19 10 19 19 10 10 10
And the answer here is you want to find an online broker	70 41 22 49 79 79 70 50 50 53 79 79
somewhere between 200 to 600	41 68 67 67 70
time keep practicing keep learning and I	41 71 71 71 71 71 71
meet him alright that ' s it for this	71 71 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
right but if you ' re watching videos like	40 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 49
only talking about sag - aftra this	40 49 50 50 50 50 50
I wanna have that playing on the speakers	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because of my unique strengths and	79 79 79 79 79 79
and their introduction to Python and advanced Python series	71 71 71 71 71 41 40 49 49
a real estate agent is that you	40 40 67 70 40 40 40
an industry that ' s built on	76 79 76 76 76 77 77
but the problem with this whole I want	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
just so you can get something from them	64 64 64 67 76 79 79 76
guys to think of every single purchase	43 70 79 70 79 61 70
commercials actors see a lot of	50 49 49 79 79 79
your only thing especially if you are in	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

then that eligibility does not expire	50 40 67 67 70 71
with an online broker	70 67 67 43
that was about nine hundred fifty	0 0 0 0 0 0
one of the questions that i get a lot	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and they tell you how they got started	49 49 41 50 41 50 50 50
the same as the ones that i had recorded	76 76 68 41 71 71 71 71 71
And so the real lesson here is that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
we don ' t engage	79 79 79 79 79
the casting breakdown or the character	79 79 79 79 79 79
buying the product after visiting the thing	49 49 49 49 79 79 79
working after your feet and hearings	71 71 68 68 71 68
skim through the material and	40 40 40 40 40
run with it and try and do those things	79 79 79 79 52 52 52 52 52
might break unexpectedly there are tons	79 79 79 79 79 79
So grab a cup of tea and we can talk about it	76 76 76 46 19 46 49 73 46 64 37 37
now that we have a hundred people ' s money	49 49 49 67 67 67 52 52 52 52

of friends that have moved out there	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
with the pandemic also if you bank with	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
having it printed on both sides again if	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you were not signed with them so now	79 71 71 71 71 71 71 79 79
calling just know that there are so many	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
little bit more risky so you definitely	28 31 31 31 31 31 1
interview them on my channel so that i	76 76 77 77 49 49 41 41
purposes now you will also hear the term	71 70 79 76 76 76 76 76
that when they get water on them they	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
know give me an inside peek at what the	80 79 49 49 49 79 79 52 79
that you can do while	49 49 79 49 80
what felt like milliseconds after we sat	49 37 67 67 68 67 67
if you go all the way down	70 70 79 80 51 51 51
print photos most of us might actually	79 79 79 79 79 49 49
outsourced as much as you possibly can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
for doing things like this YouTube channel	64 67 67 64 74 65 64
they can set whatever rules that they	49 41 79 71 70 79 79
that i have in my business and the time	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
make especially	50 80
like a house with let ' s say five	79 79 79 76 76 76 76 79 79
care professional to really help you out	32 41 41 41 41 41 41
from people	53 80
it was a new disney plus show and i	41 40 49 49 40 40 49 50 50
our time is is limited and so if you	51 50 46 49 49 49 49 19 22
that they want to buy these days buyers	43 43 43 79 79 79 79 79
you put this on the MLS the next morning	79 52 52 43 43 79 79 79 79
alright let ' s talk about the vampire	50 50 50 50 41 41 41 41
money in this industry	71 71 0 0
there ' s so many people literally	79 79 79 70 79 70 70
a real agent doesn ' t charge you any	41 40 67 67 67 67 67 67 70
these two agencies they solely exist to	76 44 67 70 49 70 79
to like my eight email contact and told	2 19 2 76 76 76 76 76
and then it would be 130 something	53 53 80 80 53 53 53
should go full time or what you should	79 79 79 76 80 79 79 79
help you stand out hey let ' s have some	64 62 62 70 49 49 49 49 41 41
and see if they go to your city or maybe	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49 49
I think this was when I made my iPad video	33 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
off of monologues and onto other aspects	51 50 50 40 40 40 40
production and how quickly they got	49 49 49 40 43 40
you can also ask other actors and your	50 50 50 50 80 77 71 70
And so in terms of starting out	71 41 41 70 61 61 10
really sought not only was I totally	41 41 71 68 68 68 76
behind the camera anything that you can	68 68 52 49 49 50 41
Cut Pro like it ' s it ' s so easy you could	21 21 21 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42
And that ' s what dictates the CPM or cost per mille	64 64 64 64 67 67 67 40 49 70 70 40
you learn the skills	68 65 68 62
movie credits right now i ' m talking	76 76 76 77 77 77 77 77
fraction of the actual number of paid	80 80 53 80 53 53 80
shoulders up	14 23
but the rental rate is only about six	79 79 79 79 79 80 79 79
you can create a free profile on actors	79 79 79 79 79 79 71 71
it in a second first let me explain	77 77 77 41 41 41 41 41
At least those are based on my figures	58 58 58 59 59 58 58 58
you set a salary of forty thousand	32 31 31 31 31 40 40
and that ' s meant that I ' ve actually had	70 70 70 70 67 67 70 70 70 70 70
And it ' s exactly like that with house prices	70 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76 76
a lot more in this video we are focusing	44 44 80 68 41 40 71 71 44
let ' s get started	52 52 52 71 71
And the only reason people will pay for it	62 63 63 62 62 71 71 71 63
that two to six hundred dollars might be	71 71 80 79 49 41 71 71

also touches on a lot it ' s the thought	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
now speaking of auditioning once you	79 71 71 71 70 70
is your network industry where the more	71 68 70 71 70 70 68
When you ' re in you ' re first year of medical school	79 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 52 79 70 70 80
on a commercial with a celebrity so both	40 40 41 71 71 79 52 52
And it becomes this iterative process	58 58 61 61 61 61
it was around $ 25 , 000 from BMAT Ninja	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58

see if you can find someone else who is	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
Don ' t worry about like I shared this essay plan	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
I ' d be looking forward to testing myself with active recall	37 37 37 37 37 40 40 49 49 76 0 0
course for example i took my salesperson	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
then just open a general investment account with Vanguard	49 49 79 70 70 77 77 41 49
products like there is the paper like	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
old but the owners of this house just a	79 79 77 77 79 77 79 79 79
you ' ll have to be a legal us resident	70 70 70 71 79 71 71 71 79 70
at your own pace so let ' s say you have a	3 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
microphone closer to me and further away	68 68 68 64 67 67 71
courses and stuff were a thing so you	79 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
on the board which is great really we	49 50 50 50 50 50 41 50
money for it	52 51 51
nobody can teach you how to become	71 44 50 80 80 80 53
little bit about	49 49 49
Prius put that on a tripod to stabilize	71 67 70 71 71 71 71 0
just learn from the process the two most	53 53 53 40 40 31 31 31
30 40 or more credits	0 0 0 0 0
it ' s a house that you are gonna be happy	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
of course not and that ' s what it ' s like	49 49 49 49 79 79 79 79 71 71 71 71
checks as well so it can be a great	70 71 70 79 80 80 71 80 41
the kitchen or in the living room you	81 80 80 79 79 79 79 79
and do you need to move anywhere at all	70 71 80 79 79 79 79 52 52
share it with all of you guys	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
doing the homework and practicing your	49 49 49 13 13 13
So the second thing that determines	31 40 40 40 40 67
maybe 1pm or 2pm	41 41 41 41
a year but when you are first starting	70 70 70 67 67 67 67 67
and demo reels	70 49 49
print that ' s it pretty easy right if you	0 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
personally I went with 4 inch because	79 79 79 79 70 70 70
and you know technically historical performance	79 79 49 79 70 70
get it is way too much to handle all	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
acting teachers what are the websites	70 70 67 70 70 67
and thinks that stunt performing might	67 67 67 70 70 70
residual payments are payments that you	79 79 79 79 79 79
with family and friends	51 42 51 51
mcdonald ' s commercial	0 0 0 0
of either building an audience	58 58 58 58 59
Have a great life and I ' ll see you later	79 79 52 52 52 79 79 79 79 79 79
agents and casting directors are not	79 79 80 79 79 79
so for example let ' s say you start	41 41 40 70 70 70 70 50 50
online education so if you can teach	79 70 43 52 52 71 71
choosing to do a solo 401k	49 40 40 31 31 31
and had zero audience when she started	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
honestly is with other students in your	49 49 49 52 52 49 52
auditioning for real stuff yes you can	40 71 41 41 41 41 71
full - time without doing it full - time and	79 79 79 79 61 70 70 70 70 79
and that the last thing that you want as an actor is to look fake	71 71 41 41 41 41 50 49 49 50 41 71 71 71 71
more and more stuff we buy and then the	49 49 40 67 67 10 10 1 20
work for	79 76
helped give them confidence that i was	76 76 79 68 77 77 77
that ' s very easy to justify as a business expense	47 47 47 51 47 51 10 10 51 15 18
because if your face gets seen as a	50 50 50 50 50 51 51 42
calls it ' s more focused on you know we	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
mostly through the attention that I	49 49 40 49 50 50
really like the fact that i started at	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and uh when i was just getting started i	79 52 79 79 79 79 79 79 52
i ultimately decided to go ahead and	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and do all of those things because look	52 52 52 50 41 41 41 41
is effectively a myth and why you don	79 79 79 79 79 79 49 49
People always end up losing money	70 70 70 70 70 70
the YouTube creator team have hinted	41 41 41 41 41 41
And so I would have known about the fact	0 43 25 25 79 70 70 70 70
and if you want to download that free	44 44 44 44 44 44 44 53
how to start a successful side hustle	41 41 49 49 49 49 41
something like that let ' s say your	70 79 79 70 70 70 40 40
necessarily your most	40 40 40
qualified to be doing what we ' re doing	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
union auditions when you are a non	70 52 79 79 79 79 79
with that won ' t reduce the quality of	61 70 70 70 70 79 79 79 79
can ' t do that because it ' s a title of a	49 49 49 49 76 67 67 67 67 67 67 71 71
single one so I hope this actually	79 79 71 70 41 41 41
is because	79 79
side of the union a few quick	71 41 41 71 77 41 41
be on sale or at least some variant of	19 19 19 62 43 43 70 79 79
it ' s a big decision so do your research	76 76 76 49 50 80 71 68 71 70

So high leverage housekeeping	79 79 79 52
after you do pass the test first	71 49 49 79 79 79 71
just think about the environment that you ' re in	80 80 53 53 80 79 49 49 49 71
could see just how nice this house	1 1 1 1 1 1 1
look real I eventually learned that what I was doing was	71 71 71 71 41 41 41 40 49 49 49

spending some time with you today if you	41 41 41 41 41 41 68 77
license to buy my own place because I	40 43 40 40 40 40 31 31
recap on the timeline here because i got	70 71 70 70 67 67 76 80
else in different state then the basic	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
license and after that you ' ll be able to	79 79 49 79 79 79 79 70 70 70
usually it ' s because I forgot to have fun	19 49 49 49 49 49 49 19 49 40
online and if you ' re looking for a	49 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
make you money people hire you for your	79 79 79 0 0 10 0 0
story already is that	41 41 40 49
audition so	41 41
inspiration and furnished and it would	67 71 68 71 71 71
one of my first movie auditions and I	67 67 67 67 71 71 41 41
jobs so	67 67
once we start thinking of money as this	49 49 80 50 50 50 50 40
some people have said that house prices	70 44 44 79 70 49 76
on YouTube you need a thousand subscribers	37 40 37 49 79 79 76
is a business it costs a lot of money to	50 80 80 50 80 80 71 71 80 80
and just not even realizing it	52 52 52 52 49 49
up for some type of practice question	41 41 41 41 49 49 23
don ' t want to over renovate ideally	31 31 31 31 31 31 58 31
on the other hand a 500 000 home in	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to sign up with your affiliate link	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
And just having that mindset encourages us	79 52 52 52 79 52 52
transitioning from the process	40 40 40 40
specifically for that medium so i highly	50 50 50 67 67 71 71
to the niceties the positive	0 0 1 0 0
if they wanted to go to Tyler Buckingham	40 40 46 46 40 41 40 49
possibly but i somehow i doubt it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
buy that product now of course the most	31 40 41 41 40 40 49 50
that is not directly tied to our time	58 58 58 58 58 67 67 67
telling you is these are the actions and	40 40 40 40 49 49 49 50
you can help you know help people find	49 49 49 50 50 50 50 50
the S & amp ; P 500 has more than doubled	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 52 43 52 52
standpoint exactly why they ' re giving	43 79 79 79 79 79 79
been so incredibly helpful in more of	80 79 79 79 79 79 79
Another example of a paid membership community	49 49 49 49 40 40 40
everybody so that means you ' re probably	79 49 49 79 79 79 79 79
smaller property that is only a single	41 40 40 53 53 52 53
other actors that have done that as well	70 67 70 70 67 71 71 71
are found on lots of the older homes	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
put our billing	0 0 0
out and you ' re burning yourself out of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the rule of thumb is to not list your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so i really want you to think about	79 79 79 79 79 52 79 79
prevent living paycheck to paycheck	70 79 79 79 79
to date it ' s still one of the most	79 76 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 71
for just the second and then come right back you ' ll make your conversations look a hundred	41 41 41 41 71 71 41 40 40 40 40 40 41 41 41 41 49 49
lot easier to save money and not keep	40 40 40 31 40 40 40 40
project is either a union project or a	71 80 80 80 71 71 71 71
it ' s still a heck of a lot better than	79 79 79 79 71 71 70 70 70 79 71
how i auditioned for those	41 41 41 71 71
way to show them that you are going to	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
important for people to understand of	67 41 41 41 40 40
that ' s it for this video if you liked it	49 49 49 49 49 64 64 65 65 69 71
and easy way to get your license thank	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
that you should know is that you can do	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the commercial somewhere during that	41 41 41 41 41
not going to be possible and everyone	40 40 40 40 40 49 40
and try and apply your new learning to it	70 70 70 70 70 79 79 70 79
is the best this is at the end of the	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
can for the location you really need to	31 49 49 52 40 40 40 40
other loan programs that are extremely	71 71 71 70 79 70
as if this thing is harder than it actually is	71 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62
I ' m non - pro has a copy of it at the end	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
baseline that almost everyone is going	40 40 40 67 67 67
40 percent of your paycheck to them just	40 40 41 41 41 41 41 40
We all have this thing that	55 58 58 67 67 67
$ 100 , 000 loan just to keep it simple	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
weight so I ' m more conscious of how much	50 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
mortgage that is considered 80 % LTV loan	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because you trust me and my fund Gringotts	70 52 49 76 70 71 71 19
then in three years time you build up a	0 21 21 76 77 76 49 49 49
that shaq was going to be involved i was	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 49 49
kai on netflix	71 71 71
in the nba	49 49 76
and while you ' re doing that make a plan	70 70 70 70 70 40 79 79 76 70
over 900	79 79
much as possible	79 79 79
that most people would give for beginners	49 49 49 19 49 67 64
in or the state	41 53 53 77
to pause for a moment before you said your next line	49 49 49 49 49 41 41 71 71 71 71
number one have at least	49 76 79 79 49
character now instead of going through	71 68 68 67 67 67
a lot of people want to know what are	79 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
smaller market and then at some point in	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
copying and pasting so it doesn ' t take	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and all of those things which is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
to save money wherever they can and one	68 68 71 71 71 77 71 71
plus I think it looks more professional	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And so a stock market index	49 79 79 76 67 70
commercial nothing in the audition	68 68 41 68 67
funding fee of two point one five	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for those types of projects so if you	80 80 71 71 71 79 79 79
tipping point it ' s what ' s that point	79 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71

that side of my business and the passive	77 79 79 79 79 79 79 76
they hire someone who	70 40 40 70
actually in line with what we say we	71 70 70 49 49 49 79 79
above eight minutes	40 31 31
thinking about whether or not you should	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
thumb in a really bad way so make sure	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

that was pretty solid alternatively and	52 52 52 25 52 52
want you guys to know how important	40 40 49 49 49 40 31
an hour or two long and is telling a	71 67 71 71 71 71 71 79 79
to be the difference between 0 . 55 and	70 76 71 71 71 71 71 71 70
step 8 is the casting director reviewing	79 79 79 79 79 78 79
immerse yourself with every possible	40 40 40 40 40
because it just sounds so you know	80 80 50 19 19 19 19
choose to take an in - person classroom	58 31 37 37 70 70 70 67
this is kind of nice	28 1 1 1 1
uh earlier this year maybe it was last	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
experience without auditioning and	76 76 76 76
and i hope to see you on set one day	79 79 70 71 71 70 70 70 0 0
actors on first refusal	70 70 70 70
want to make sure that it ' s clear i	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 64 67
so I was like you know what let ' s see if	49 49 40 50 50 47 46 46 46 46 46 46
but generally online courses are in video format	43 43 61 70 79 50 49 49
experience and i should have done it for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
there ' s a role for	79 79 79 79 80 79
of membership communities work	49 49 49 49
a very turnkey house number four is to	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
We ordered pizza	0 0 0
ever joined the union while living in	40 40 40 40 68 68 68
actors equity for example then you are	81 80 71 71 50 50 40
leave ended up having hair down here and	46 46 46 46 46 46 46 46
still no mention of shaq nobody told me	49 49 49 49 76 79 76 41
and that ' s like immediate gratification	67 64 64 64 64 64 64
depending on which country you ' re in	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
officers desk that I would be sitting at	49 64 64 67 67 67 67 49
vertically turn your foot turn your	73 73 73 73 73 73
i ' m going to try to give you the best	76 76 76 76 49 49 49 79 52 79 79
uh if you want to get an entertainment	68 68 71 71 71 71 71 71
estate about investing personal finance	38 50 50 47 50
the desk setup only has 75 , 000 hours which is quite a lot	60 60 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 63 62 62 0
deals and especially if you ' re going to	31 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
audition classes stunt classes stage	71 71 71 70 71
so the next question that i get	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
okay that ' s it for this video those were	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
television side of an acting career	50 50 50 50 71 71

i ' ll say about acting classes	44 44 44 77 50 52 49
financial literacy	70 79
like and for me you know whenever i put	79 79 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
booked this second commercial without	40 40 40 40 40
love that because it ' s something that	40 40 40 49 49 49 49 40
is that everyone is friendly	79 79 79 79 79
romeo and juliet you play juliet little	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ingrained in me	79 79 79
and I will continue preaching that	41 41 5 32 41 41
I wouldn ' t recommend doing the physical	49 49 49 49 41 40 40 40
this spot by just reviewing his initial	76 76 76 77 78 69 42
you might be prospecting all day trying	67 67 67 67 67 67 70
production a union production or	71 79 79 64 64

how I learned to code that sort of stuff	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 40 49
home inspection is so	76 76 49 40
if you get down between 720 and 740 then	79 79 79 79 79 79 70 79 79
would the casting director send me this	52 52 52 79 79 52 79
of a manly death okay what like maybe	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

sitting down and watching videos	33 33 33 33 33
character in the movie underseas where	79 79 79 79 79 79
ever worked on I appeared in season 8	71 71 71 71 67 70 70 70
how they were able to make that happen	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 68
of the things that you want to buy will	19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
is that even a slight increase in your fees	70 70 64 64 67 67 70 70 76
because they charge way too high fees	40 67 67 43 51 51 51
makes it very easy to crop any image	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
debate over whether or not to put your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
need a scene partner again and that	76 76 73 73 73 73 73
these tips are gonna apply and they	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
based on how many shares they own	70 70 40 70 70 61 31
you live in a right to work state	70 70 70 70 70 70 52 52
working in the corporate world and	79 79 79 79 79 79
And the vast majority of that is in the S & amp ; P 500 index fund	53 53 53 53 53 79 79 79 67 58 58 58 58 58 58 61 61
other line none of the actors in the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
i was living in cleveland ohio and i had	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 68 67
on in the past few years here in atlanta	49 50 50 50 50 41 41 41 50
after I get up but the first thing I do	70 37 40 40 40 49 49 49 49 49
you can do real estate part - time but	70 70 70 70 70 25 25 25 25
so the lesson here is if you are a newer	49 77 77 77 77 77 77 76 76 76
which is my 10 - step audition preparation	68 76 76 79 79 79 77 80
selecting which actors they would like	76 77 76 71 71 71
take into consideration and that is if	79 79 79 79 76 0 0
Express was the cheapest option and was	67 40 40 40 67 67 40
and forget it and it ' s not that hard to maintain	58 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63
their answers and you understand the	49 49 49 49 49 49
real estate if your real estate business	67 40 40 52 43 71 71
fourth step is to	40 40 40 40
here they have a little spot where you	51 51 50 47 48 48 47 50
allow you to use gift funds from	70 70 70 70 70 70 70
and that massively changes how much money	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
professional actor	41 41
I ' m gonna give myself a break today	67 67 67 70 70 70 70 70 70
and fun in a way that really	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
learn that this can be another way that	70 80 50 50 41 71 50 49
and then finally this is one final thing	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 41
on camera feel more normal because the	41 41 41 44 71 77 77
it means it ' s taxed at 19 % for corporation tax	79 52 53 53 53 54 79 79 79 81 79 79
So yoU . S . pent $ 90 on buying 10 shares in Apple	61 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
sales and the total cost of the class is	67 70 67 67 71 71 70 70 70
for improvement so ask around for some	71 71 71 68 71 71 79
to tell their story okay now that we	68 68 71 71 79 71 71 71
something like this is to shoot a scene	67 70 70 70 70 70 70 71
boring video right but I just wanted you	79 79 49 50 77 77 76 76
and yet i ' ve been able to work on a	52 53 71 71 71 71 71 71 67 43 43
spending some time here with me today	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
fulfillment is our compass and our	11 0 0 0 0 0
I ' ll see you guys in the next video	67 67 67 70 70 70 0 0 0 0
homework assignments but besides that	79 79 79 79 79
impulsive purchases	68 77
the more that they see you you	76 79 76 79 79 79 79
Secondly the things I ' m passionate about	50 46 46 46 46 46 46 11
like tons and tons of stuff that you can learn	11 11 11 21 21 21 21 21 20 19
The problem with that type of thinking	41 41 41 49 41 41 41
with Python you can do anything from	80 50 49 49 49 49 49
making a few dozen pounds a day off of YouTube ads	32 32 32 58 61 40 40 40 40 40 67
And for the next 10 years	49 79 79 76 76 76
2 % in Facebook 2 % in Google 2 % in Microsoft	49 49 41 49 49 49 49 49 37 37 40 31
one role for simplicity let ' s say	79 77 80 80 79 79 79 79
because you do have to keep on making podcast episodes	52 52 52 25 52 52 52 79 79 52
like and trust you from the value that	21 50 77 77 49 52 52 52
in your hand right now	38 11 11 11 11
your atm fees so definitely look for	71 71 40 40 79 71 71
that we pay attention to detail when it	79 76 79 79 79 80 80 79
they ' ve got very high ratings	41 41 41 41 41 41 50
photographers like family photographers	53 53 53 53
you end up investing in all of them a little bit at a time	52 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is sort of like with houses	70 70 70 70 70 52
and then the walking dead is on amc	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
no regrets of starting at the age that i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
You ' re gonna walk around	81 81 81 42 42 77
to audition for those bigger projects	70 71 49 79 79 79
and if you ' re sitting here thinking well	79 80 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
look at the workout if you don ' t want	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
in terms of life energy for example if	52 52 43 43 70 21 21 12
on an	41 41
in stocks and shares as soon as you possibly can	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 77 70 70
instead of an actor you were a graphic	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
wrong in fact he made it all the way to	52 79 79 64 64 64 76 76 76 76
finding the right actor to fill a	40 40 70 70 41 50 50
Firstly you wanna make sure that	70 70 70 49 49 49
at my YouTuber friend and colleague Shelby Church	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67
application and mail it in to your	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
excuse anymore at all if you want to	21 21 0 47 47 1 1 1
the science behind it or the the	67 43 67 49 49 49 40
on your older videos	50 41 44 41
you what residuals are	41 41 71 49
for example you get tax advantages and	40 41 40 40 41 40 40
storyboards especially during our	79 70 70 79
ask your friend to do it don ' t go to	79 79 79 79 79 67 67 67 67 70 71
either ordinary joe or dopesick or just	49 40 40 49 41 50 41
That ' s actually been really fun	76 76 76 76 50 50 71
feel like you ' re burning out i can think	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
if you liked the video	79 71 71 71 79
that are those little option banner ads	60 49 40 40 40 40 40
you ' ll actually be able to fill out an	49 49 49 71 70 67 67 40 40 40
and those sacrifices that have to be	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
Ideally you shouldn ' t be putting any money	61 61 76 76 76 52 79 71 70
pretty stagnant and you ' re really	28 31 31 28 28 28 28
the outcome of your action is going to be	67 79 70 70 79 49 70 70 70
from every other single person	67 79 79 79 79
going to be in the commercial so now	62 62 62 62 71 71 77 50
acting classes in your city	79 79 77 80 77
happened to me	70 70 79
whether it ' s been an audition for a	53 53 53 53 50 50 71 71 71
everywhere and we react to them even if it	79 71 49 49 49 49 41 41 71
solely on becoming a real estate agent	40 67 40 68 70 70 70
mortgage payments they can jump into a	71 71 71 71 70 61 70
but I just didn ' t think about investing	71 71 71 71 71 71 70 71 71
the fact that it ' s gone up by 50	62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 62 61
take a lot of write - offs that you	31 1 28 28 28 28 28 31 31
buy insult property if you ' re really	70 71 79 70 70 70 70 76
and create your own acting resume off of	67 67 67 67 67 67 70 67
it was just one of those books that and	50 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50
online that means you can sign up for a	79 79 40 40 70 70 70 70 70
yourself then	41 40
of acting and not just be in love with	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
you know please do not audition for the	28 28 28 28 28 28 28 29
instead of single - family residences	49 52 61 61 61 58
the money doesn ' t go directly to them	41 41 50 50 50 50 50 41 71
move and well	41 41 41
rather do it themselves and and because	46 41 41 50 49 49 40
And I ' ve even got a one hour class	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
they ' re gonna do all the work for me now	64 64 64 73 67 67 76 70 80 80 71
might be asking now well the question	41 41 41 41 41 49 80
maybe they just needed someone taller	79 67 67 67 71 71
out there that can provide you for x	61 70 79 79 79 79 79 79
chances of being in that small	71 71 71 71 71 71
so let ' s say this could be part of your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that and then just spending maybe a few	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
thanks to minimalism honestly we need a	43 40 61 61 52 52 79
you ' ll have paid off the a 100 , 000 pounds that you ' ve put in	67 67 67 67 67 70 67 67 70 70 70 40 40 49 49 49 49 79
a 25 meal if you spend that money right	70 70 70 61 61 61 63 43 70
even more on the only the things that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
when someone doubts me or even when i	79 79 79 79 76 76 77 77
so now you might be thinking wow that	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 79
your body does have a place to progress	49 40 41 41 41 41 41 41
although these weren ' t really a thing in 2009	70 49 79 79 79 70 61 79 76 76
most of our lives we often feel like we	46 49 49 49 67 67 40 0 -59
so now why do non - union productions even	49 49 49 40 40 40 40 40 40
this whole aesthetic makes me really enjoy	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and you lose a deal as a result these	40 40 40 68 40 40 40 40 40
collaborative that acting is	49 79 79 40
kind of audience as Gary Vaynerchuk and	58 58 58 58 49 49 52
going to be way more effective once	41 41 40 40 40 40 40
there are like literally hundreds of examples of people	46 46 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
major movies and television shows are	40 67 67 70 70 49
book a television show and now i ' m going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
other countries but i have no experience	67 40 49 49 79 79 71
lender in your area tell them about your	41 41 41 41 79 79 80 79
the next thing you have to know is that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
or try and sell them something and he	71 71 71 71 50 49 49 49
and you are shopping loans getting	70 70 35 70 70 70
because of that we want to make sure our	77 80 80 77 77 77 80 80 80
long term you ' re going to be really glad	49 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
where you ' ve done all those things	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80
to be very difficult to buy unless you	40 41 31 31 31 40 40 49
part of a role we ' d be uncomfortable	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
aren ' t going to need that whole time the	70 70 70 70 70 71 70 79 79 79
i get the feeling of wanting to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
doing four hours per day	13 41 41 67 40
three percent of sixty thousand dollars	31 31 40 31 31 31
is suited for your learning style and	70 79 79 79 70 79 79
the international actors out there the	71 71 40 40 67 67
three days and then they go back to you	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
markets like los angeles	49 50 50 77
this portfolio to show people to say i	49 31 31 31 31 31 64 67
sizes I had never heard the term sides	41 41 71 49 49 49 49 76
who are the creators of stranger things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
channel if you new here my name is Ali	53 53 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
advertisements and things like that	76 76 49 50 41
conversation and the emotional reality	40 40 40 43 43
you know every single day is going to be	40 40 49 49 49 40 40 40 40
you ' d find in a hospital now obviously I	80 80 80 79 79 79 79 79 52 79
this off and this brings me into my next	31 40 49 49 76 49 49 40 40
to get it to the point where you will	70 70 79 79 79 79 76 49 49
helps to do your own research too	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and learn on the internet	49 49 49 49 49
the producers now	50 80 71
after two years and likely pay	70 79 79 79 79 79
I ' ve put the effort into creating the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
word or not there are only a certain	49 49 40 40 40 49 40 40
two hours away from cleveland and at the	68 68 68 68 68 68 67 71
schedule I think one of the questions is	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
seen this approach work for some actors	79 79 76 79 79 79 79
seriously which doctor are you going to	49 79 76 67 67 67 70
artist ' s rendition of the frames for	49 49 49 49 49 49 50 50
drop whatever they ' re doing and focus	67 40 40 40 40 40 40 10
because a that would have encouraged	41 44 44 77 49 49
need to be able to fit right in and I	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
amazing tool that you can use not only	79 79 79 79 79 79 80 49
the acting career center here to help	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
and that ' s all i knew and the original	41 41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 41
So again let ' s say we wanna make $ 100 a month	41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41
I ' m speaking as a writer I would like my	6 6 6 6 3 6 6 6 6 6 6
and commercials and theater in fact let	79 49 40 67 67 76 73
which is that what is obvious to you	79 79 52 25 25 52 25 43
increasingly it ' s becoming easier and	22 49 49 49 49 49 19
you don ' t have to join after working	80 53 53 53 53 50 50 72 80
has taken over the major part of our	0 0 21 21 0 0 76 79
well i ' m glad you asked i ' ve actually	71 71 71 71 71 71 50 71 71 71 71
able to share with you	68 67 68 50 41
also the director gave me some lines	64 64 64 64 64 64 68
and asking what did I do wrong well	73 73 73 73 73 79 79 79
number two is to have a non distracting	21 21 21 1 1 1 1 0
on TV it ' s like that very safe modern	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
dollar industry like this one there are	71 71 79 79 70 70 70
life as a landlord easy because if you	-89 -89 -89 -89 -59 -59 1 19
But that ' s trying to predict the future	52 52 52 52 52 79 67 64 67
on earth the precious hours of life	11 11 21 21 11 21 0
that ' s crazy how much more opportunity	49 49 49 49 49 49 79 71
it takes you longer than expected to	40 40 40 31 31 31 31
the scene a million times so my instinct	71 71 71 71 71 71 41 41
as is the case with most things	41 41 41 41 70 70 70
for most beginners as a non - financial advisor	19 49 50 49 20 21 21 21 19
able to do that anyway but it does make	49 49 49 49 40 40 49 49 49
So that ' s quite hard if you ' re thinking	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 40 40 40 41
on how to get started with investing	52 49 49 70 40 61 61
ultimately it went to somebody else but	52 52 52 52 52 52 79
classes and your phone without you can	67 71 71 76 76 77 77
impatient you know you got to slow down	42 42 42 51 51 51 51 51
on the zoom callback once again there	71 71 71 68 68 41 41
running Facebook or Instagram ads you	49 49 49 49 50 50
get a check in the mail at some point in	64 67 67 67 67 67 64 67 67 67
and all over the world people eat	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
they may invite you	76 76 76 76
in fact	79 79
goes a very very long way firstly towards helping you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
i started my acting career in cleveland	52 52 71 71 71 71 71
means that you can write off 5	40 37 37 31 31 28 31
combat classes the Meisner technique the	71 71 71 71 71 71
angle your face in your body so that the	40 10 11 11 11 11 41 41 41
one of the best ways of doing that	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
let me know down in the comments if you	67 67 67 70 67 67 70 70 70
and entrepreneurship so that ' s it for	50 50 41 41 41 41 41 41
But if someone feels comfortable enough to come	76 76 49 49 76 49 49 76
and providing value is hard	49 41 41 41 41
those extra expenses so they can hire me	79 80 80 77 80 80 43 43
eventually they offered me a role	44 44 44 44 44 71
if you have any ideas for what this entire series	49 49 43 43 50 50 23 49 52 50
which doctor are you going to take more	71 71 71 71 70 49 49 49
change this line and then change this	79 79 79 76 79 79 79
directors and the producers thought that	76 76 76 76 73 73
hang out we ' re typically right here in	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 51
importance of acting class but this is	70 71 71 44 79 79 70
productions are looking for someone who	40 70 70 68 68 68
Let ' s go	79 79 79 79
are at home all day some days we ' re on	76 76 76 76 79 52 26 26 26 26 26
actor because nobody starts with acting	71 71 71 49 49 49
where internally I was not okay with it	33 33 33 33 33 30 33 33
this was never this one hand it is how	79 49 50 41 41 41 68 71 41
is a mindset shift	41 40 40 40
with at least a few options it ' s always	71 70 70 79 79 79 70 70 70 70
take this	41 41
work right but guess what it gets better	79 71 71 71 40 40 67 70
small market	49 71
tuned hey guys it ' s Kurt from	0 0 67 71 71 71 71 71
so as I wipe the tea take tip number one	49 49 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
yet then you know you ' ll have to wait a	79 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71 71
we can add to the price of the car	51 51 51 47 51 51 51 51 51
in order to be successful	79 79 79 79 79
so it really is in your favor to have	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and if you haven ' t already subscribe to	79 79 79 79 79 79 76 79 79
if you look over at my resume i write	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It ' s one of those weird things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 32
have to trust you as well because if you	40 31 31 40 31 31 31 31 31
and the south east if i work on a union	49 41 41 53 26 26 26 26 26 26
in your career if you cut corners here	41 41 41 80 79 70 70 76
find them on Amazon for like twenty five	49 49 49 49 49 50 50 49
prints awesome quality headshots and it	49 79 79 79 79 79
that ' s it for today until next time keep	80 80 80 76 76 77 80 79 79 80
making instead you want to track the	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
taught in the classroom but i still feel	71 71 71 71 41 49 49 67
not going to be your forever home so	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
role if you ' re not okay with this and it	28 29 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
especially when	73 79
and in those cases i would recommend	67 70 70 70 49 49 70
put those plays on your resume as well	79 67 67 79 79 79 79 49
work as an actor you have to audition	79 79 79 79 49 41 71 70
little bit weird like stephanie like	79 79 79 79 79 79
accidentally deleted that last clip so i	70 40 61 61 79 49 49
that has a section on your resume as you	41 41 41 70 70 70 76 79 79
posted publicly so we ' re talking movies	79 79 79 79 79 79 71 71
this becomes like relatively reasonable passive income	52 70 70 40 40 50 50
a free 10 - step audition preparation	71 71 70 70 70 70 70
it looks like this is the big kitchen	0 0 0 0 0 49 79 80
was there something you think I left off	49 81 80 80 80 80 80 77
in inverted commas for the things	76 76 79 43 52 52
and personally I will be more than happy	76 77 80 80 77 77 76 77

occasionally i will have more than 48	70 68 68 70 70 70 71
down I think that ' s a mistake	79 79 79 70 70 70 70 70
acting classes	50 50
those are	70 76
brilliant or Connelly sponsoring this	51 51 51 51 51
Again it ' s one of those things that you probably	81 81 81 81 81 80 80 80 50 49 71
um it seemed like a super nice guy	41 49 49 49 41 71 71 49

to subscribe to this channel if you	41 71 71 71 71 71 71
about yourself in an audition all right	49 71 80 79 79 71 79
don ' t get too strung up on the details	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
huge benefit to having an agent because	80 80 80 80 71 80 81
you may live close to a big city if	67 67 67 40 40 67 67 67 67
You know try to make something and try and charge	79 79 52 52 79 79 80 71 71 52
what is a fair wage and that ' s where a	70 70 70 70 71 80 81 81 81 81 80
on the item so for example let ' s say we	40 31 31 31 40 40 40 40 40 49 49
before you get into real estate it takes	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

100 % commission real estate brokerage we	40 40 40 67 67 67 67
I just I ' m looking around and I catch a glimpse	67 68 68 68 68 68 67 67 67 68 68 68
of those people that they want to see	77 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
acting there ' s nothing there ' s no one	46 47 47 47 38 30 30 30 38 46
tomorrow and this is the food I ' m gonna	50 50 50 41 41 41 41 41 41 50
the beginning so if you have those two	79 76 76 79 71 71 71 77
that we all have that I know investing is risky	70 70 50 21 0 0 0 0 0 0
selling for full price now there are two	3 3 3 3 43 61 61 61
at some point in your career you	49 49 49 49 49 76 76
what the stock market is doing in the short term	49 70 70 70 71 71 71 52 49 43
that point you can actually cover up the	40 40 40 40 71 70 43 71
important it was until my freshman year	49 50 50 49 50 50 49
is to take acting classes what better	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
I ' m guilty of this spreading the good news	67 67 67 67 40 40 40 40 67 67
want to focus on so the first thing is	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and so my student loan has gone up to about 60 , 000 pounds	79 51 51 54 54 80 54 81 79 79 81 81 81 81
if you want to download that for free	43 43 43 41 68 41 41 53
forth all the way down through the	43 43 26 25 52 71 71

the same concepts will show up on your	40 40 41 41 41 40 40 40
want people	76 76
down to its first letter only I actually	79 79 79 79 79 79 71 67
And you never look at it again	49 49 79 79 79 79 52
around one dollar it ' s gonna look great	52 79 79 79 79 79 71 52 52
not book either of those roles and then	50 50 50 50 50 64 64 64
auditioning is a completely separate	67 40 40 40 40
usually means a speaking role if you	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
have a good of a score as someone that	80 80 70 71 71 71 71 71 71

briefly close your eyes and imagine the setting of the scene	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71 71
not necessarily a small city it ' s one of	50 80 80 50 49 79 79 79 79 79
you ' re just getting started	50 50 50 41 41 41
that everything becomes so much easier when	79 49 79 80 80 71 79

make sure you do it right you are	1 31 31 31 31 40 40 67
on the remaining balance and as a result	79 79 79 71 80 80 80 80
because it was stressing me out	33 33 33 32 32 32
so i don ' t think it ' s really that big of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
years into my acting career as a working	70 70 70 70 70 70 50 41

just give you an example	41 41 44 71 50
commercial with shaq	71 71 71
and it greatly reduced my living	52 52 79 79 79 79
making a lot of money doing these	41 41 41 68 71 68 41
gamification is all about gamification	77 49 52 77 77

you guys can do to increase the value	49 40 40 31 31 31 40 31
project like that you know working like	79 79 79 79 80 79 79
easiest simplest form of exercise	49 46 49 49 49
two days but I am available for the rest	71 71 71 71 71 49 49 71 71
okay with roommates	76 80 80
about the short term	80 79 79 52
that is unless you find a good tenant	40 40 31 31 31 58 58 31
of getting booked	80 80 80
can connect the TV and just have it	50 49 49 49 50 0 0 0
now it also depends on where you live	70 40 70 40 40 70 71 70
probably do your interest rate	1 1 1 1 1
interaction or at least the group	50 50 50 50 50 50
our example let ' s only focus on one	70 70 41 41 41 41 41 40 40
who submits to an agent is going to say	67 67 67 67 71 70 67 67 67
i say us i ' m kind of putting myself in	50 50 50 49 49 49 37 64 37 64 64
but you have to be willing to go first	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
what to do with my life	41 41 41 19 19 47
they are finding local	79 79 79 79
but for me for the way I want to run my	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
find a part - time job or another	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
the first way is to look in your local	67 76 76 70 50 71 70 70 80
already ahead of the game if you get an	76 76 79 79 76 76 79 79 79
they should do	71 71 40
but i built that relationship with the	76 76 73 79 79 73 79
How do we motivate ourselves to be productive	50 49 49 40 49 76 76 76
people if you like real estate itself	67 67 40 40 40 40 40
Basically don ' t worry about the stuff that it ' s out	53 53 53 53 52 52 53 43 43 43 43 43 43
getting taken advantage of	80 79 79 79
the writer and the director and	32 29 2 38 30 33
so if it ' s something that you feel	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
this one was not going to be self	77 77 77 77 77 71 71 71
part - time and gradually ease my way into	64 64 64 67 67 41 67 40 76
go to your favorite store and find that	62 71 71 79 79 70 70 70

you only pay a certain percentage	34 61 61 61 61 31
that ' s 135 hours of in - class time	79 79 79 79 70 70 49 49 49 79

didn ' t like it give me a thumbs down	53 53 53 52 52 53 53 53 53 53

podcast now	68 40
when you pursue an acting career and	79 79 79 71 71 40 41
they are looking for actors who have	71 71 71 71 77 80 80
Instead what you need to do is start investing it	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
lot harder	71 71
auditions i just want to say if you are	79 76 76 76 76 76 77 77 77
If you have an existing audience	58 58 58 58 58 58
things and not the money or the number	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

Your Inner World Medical School And Ever	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
performance nights where they do a	49 41 68 50 49 49
So I make a load of money	24 51 50 76 76 49 52
and I think personally more trouble than	46 22 49 41 41 41 44
extra couple hours whatever it is but	76 43 41 43 43 70 41
and then the name of the director is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

thought they needed me next week and	53 71 71 71 71 80 76
whatever it may be	49 41 41 41
worth pursuing is ever easy like they	71 71 71 71 71 49 49
you learn the skills you need to break	68 68 68 68 68 68 40 41
moving to one of the major production	79 77 71 71 68 80 71
order to succeed there ' s so many people	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
funds ready just in case something	52 61 61 43 70 43
So you ' re not entirely reliant	79 79 79 79 76 40 70
if we go by this very average figure of 10 % a year	40 37 37 37 37 40 40 58 61 61 61 58 55
that ' s a huge win right you you are	79 79 79 76 79 79 79 79 76 76
student films and non - union indie films	67 43 68 68 68 68 50 80
commercials is actually one of the ways	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
on the project and	76 76 50 79

the actual photo these are three things	41 41 41 40 49 49 52
changed our schedule	43 43 70
for 10 years you will lose money over time	50 49 49 49 49 52 52 71 71
right so that means	76 77 77 77
chase or wells fargo account if you do	71 71 62 40 70 40 40 79
if you had started that	79 79 79 79 79

in a union state you must join the union	80 80 80 68 77 77 77 68 71

in new york or los angeles i would have	52 52 79 79 79 79 80 79 79

you enough to potentially pay you $ 100 a	49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 11

because then you will completely waste the next day	79 79 79 76 70 70 71 71 79

and all of your marketing materials that	80 80 80 80 80 80 80
resume your acting resume will always be	21 20 21 21 21 21 79
making those connections now if you	41 41 71 71 52 52
different gender than you this happens	79 79 79 79 79 79
below as well we ' ll be sure to put all	71 77 76 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
trying to do as well so it ' s extremely	70 70 71 71 71 41 50 50 50 50
reasoning for them	49 49 49
the next question is where should you	41 41 71 71 71 71 41
is what ' s the best place to live	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 80
house hack is to buy a fixer - upper for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and that	71 41
want to be an actor and then you should	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 67 67
and he kind of popped his head in the	73 73 73 73 73 73 64 64 64
all the time because that ' s what they	50 50 50 51 53 53 53 50 51
that ' s far more likely to end up in a long - term memory	79 79 79 70 70 70 70 71 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
then you really will have to move to the	80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
a costume then by all means do it a lot	79 79 67 67 67 70 70 70 77 76
online classes you also don ' t need to	70 79 79 79 76 76 76 76 76
they want they can pay whatever wages	79 79 67 67 67 62 62
maybe I just kind of move through it and	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
when your headshot goes to a casting	71 71 71 71 71 71 71
the character when it comes to you	79 79 79 79 52 79 79

access and casting networks and things	41 50 50 50 50 50

But that ' s quite hard to do no one sticks to it	50 51 51 51 51 50 50 50 49 49 49 49 49
and that ' s the perfect transition	41 41 41 41 41 50 41
I could go home and film a video that results in a video	70 70 70 67 64 67 64 67 68 68 68 68 70

Loads more links in the video description	49 49 49 49 49 49 49

which is what kind of incentivizes YouTubers	49 49 49 41 40 37 37
so just be aware of that and be ready	40 40 40 40 40 40 41 41 41
acting studios that have classes	79 41 41 41 41
now this is the step where you actually	44 43 43 40 40 40 40 31
schedule like a lot of actors do it	70 71 79 79 79 41 44 41
everyone should try and overcome	41 53 41 41 40

that if it sounds too good to be true	79 79 79 79 71 71 71 71 79
Maybe you ' ve heard on the news about	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70
to perform one of my monologues	71 71 71 71 71 71
Sitting on here it would be quite fun	64 64 64 64 64 64 64 67
and create breakdowns for those roles a	49 70 70 70 70 70 40
using props unless I really feel like	41 41 41 40 40 40 68

that ' s it for this video if you liked it	41 41 41 68 71 71 44 53 80 53 53
two i think the experience that you get	40 40 40 67 67 40 40 40
audition for the movie won ' t back down	76 76 76 76 76 76 76 76 50

our careers	40 40
the producers of the show and the	76 76 76 76 76 79 76
to make passive income and to use my personal example	58 61 58 58 61 61 58 61 61 61
that i would give and i do think that	68 68 71 71 71 71 41 41 41
so if you are already following casting	76 77 80 80 80 80 80
that how is that actually an investment	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
with it and to be honest i probably	79 79 79 52 52 52 52 52
money by actually performing	40 40 40 67
you have tons of cash to blow those look	52 52 52 79 52 79 79 79 49
you will do awesome i guarantee it so	40 40 31 31 31 31 31 13
only communication between the casting	40 40 40 40 40
you ' re buying a duplex then you only	79 79 79 79 70 79 79 79 70
seriously you have unique gifts	79 79 79 79 79
the on the other side of the camera on	64 64 64 67 67 67 40 41 71
I was already feeling like I was winning at life	32 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33
are so many other aspects of this career	80 80 80 80 80 79 79 49
and of us because i have in the	80 80 80 80 50 71 71 41
to work as like work equals suffering	40 49 46 49 41 41 41
that basketball analogy	70 71 71
Usually this is because people click on a video	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
on the performance of the stock market overall	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
is that you would give the student	67 40 46 49 64 67 67
movies that are quote unquote hollywood	49 49 49 19 49 49
throughout the semester	41 41 41
cut that together and create a demo reel	67 40 41 41 41 41 41 41
are out of our control as actors	71 71 71 71 71 49 49
little risky at first hiring someone new	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
get your money out it ' s just a waste and	71 71 40 79 79 79 79 79 49 49 79

you would be making roughly $ 100 a month	40 40 37 37 37 37 37 37 37
of course not every area is going to	44 53 53 41 41 44 44 44

10 plus years all right that ' s it for	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 71
that I didn ' t take that role as tough of	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
which is absolutely huge	0 0 50 50
someday move to the united states no	80 80 80 80 67 43 70

their homes with their significant other	79 79 79 79 79 79
saw the house two days before the actual	79 77 79 79 79 79 79 79
important decision it ' s a big decision	70 70 70 70 70 70 71 71
uh your down payment amount it ' ll also	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
will just be less stressful and most	70 70 40 70 70 43 43
to be able to loan money to people that	70 70 70 70 79 71 70 70 79
that link is also in the description	64 40 40 40 71 71 71
movies and television shows	76 76 76 40
when it ' s really really busy is like	67 67 67 67 67 70 41 71 71
in really great shape they ' re gonna be	49 49 49 49 41 41 41 41 41
which I have to say is pretty good	20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
by the time you guys see this video that	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
actors usually don ' t know where the next	79 49 76 76 76 67 43 43 79
area that the house is in because you	31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31
let ' s say you did a short film or a	80 80 80 77 77 77 77 77 50 50 50
every actor can expect to spend some	49 79 67 43 43 43 70
store and so putting this all together	1 1 1 0 1 0 1
to pay the difference so it ' s not like	79 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 71 71
the final casting decision they may have	67 70 70 70 70 70 70
forward and and with that you offer that	40 49 46 41 40 40 47 49
but I don ' t consider this house an investment	40 40 71 71 71 51 81 41 40 40
you don ' t want just to copy and paste of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
mentioned earlier that ' s the only	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
they could potentially add footage to	76 76 76 77 50 41
a lot of the success disproportionately	52 52 52 70 68 68
thank you for shouting me out and	72 72 72 72 72 68 71
think a solid color wall is the best	49 49 49 49 49 49 52 52
either the industry or I have presented	46 46 46 37 41 32 29
easier to find people who are willing to	19 22 49 41 41 71 71 71
I ' m gonna share with you everything that	79 79 79 76 76 79 79 79 79
you ' re deciding where you want to move	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 81 72
for a different role for that movie	67 68 71 71 71 71 71
Brilliant have paid me to do that particular sponsor plug	0 0 0 3 71 71 71 71 71 71
by just doing what everyone else is	71 80 80 79 79 79 79
dvd so if somebody buys a dvd of a	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
And so when I remember to have fun	44 44 44 44 41 41 41 77
and why is that it ' s because	49 49 49 49 41 41 41 11
be much higher at about 2 . 25 percent so	61 61 61 70 71 70 70 70 70 70
everything alone um they are incredible	80 80 79 80 79 79
work does not	0 0 0

keeping people poor	0 0 0
always fair like this credit score	52 53 44 44 53 53
So if you ' re a business owner	51 51 51 51 51 51 81 78
and you ' re it ' s another opportunity to	50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50
only actor in the room who had the full	68 41 40 40 49 49 49 49 52
if you ' re interested in that video i	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 76 76
on youtube and when you improve yourself	79 79 79 43 79 70 79
getting paid for it nobody ' s asking them	80 80 80 80 53 53 53 53 80
websites that may cost some money in	67 40 40 40 40 43 40
throughout most of it and I was really	68 68 68 68 68 68 67 67
insurance for a VA loan but the thing	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
up it could be a wider full body shot	49 49 49 76 49 49 49 67 67
that position	80 79
sometimes you ' re really busy sometimes	23 23 23 23 23 50 40
that has been valuable over a long period of time	68 63 63 63 63 59 58 58 58 58
to make that happen and i say that fully	71 80 71 41 71 71 71 71 71
for a brokerage make sure to hit me up	31 31 40 40 40 40 40 31 31
of how we can make money in our careers	76 67 67 68 68 41 41 41 41
while maintaining those expenses	52 79 80 79
I was gonna make 700 quid in a day from YouTube ads	22 22 22 22 22 22 22 23 23 23 23 23
and the medical student has to try to	71 71 53 50 71 53 50 50
because Apple is a very valuable company	0 0 49 79 79 79 52
so let ' s say you book a role on stranger	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
couple things I wanted to talk about	49 19 49 49 19 14 41
so assume you were in a short film	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what it means to be both union and	80 80 68 68 71 71 79 79
make a resume like this regardless of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
remodel can range anywhere from a few	50 50 80 50 81 81 52
in sugars I ' m pretty sure ninety percent	49 40 41 41 41 41 49 49 49
because that ' s where the majority of	49 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
house hacking it helps to have a clear	79 79 52 52 79 79 79 79
that so	70 68
number two is just to be in the game and	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 40 41
there you will find commercials on there	41 41 41 41 41 41 41
beginners but i think anyone will find	40 40 40 40 40 40 40
generational wealth you can have cash	31 31 31 31 40 40
every single time that you have one and	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
star in exchange for some money and	71 70 70 70 70 79 79
personally our water heater just like	79 76 79 79 79 79
and final column here is going to be the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
as small well one thing you can do is to	41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 40 71
this audience of people who know like	67 67 67 40 41 49 49

money you ' re putting in and you	31 28 28 28 31 31 31 31
on your iPhone or phone whatever phone you ' re using	40 41 49 49 40 58 58 58 58 58 58
doing something else while doing that	50 50 46 49 49 49
you ' re automating and streamlining as	70 70 70 79 79 79 79
getting released that i ' ve worked on	49 49 41 71 71 71 71 67
affiliate partnerships with certain	49 49 49 49
gonna that ' s you know all of us people	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
throughout space but also how its	41 41 50 50 50 50
lenders as long as you have above a 740	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
basically my whole goal is to teach you	79 79 49 40 40 40 79 70
student films	77 77
they look very modern and they ' re gonna	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
university professor just just be	79 79 79 79 79
those student films again	70 71 71 49
you get the returns and I take a 1 % or 2 % management fee	50 50 23 21 23 80 79 49 49 49 79 52 52 50 50
and a couple lights while recording your	71 71 70 70 67 67 67
So that ' s pretty good	67 67 67 67 67 67
get a chance to act and get a chance to	49 49 49 49 40 40 40 41 41 41
colleges and universities even community	80 71 71 70 79
people are watching your videos	40 40 41 41 40
you were an actor in the movie and your	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 81
blone programs out there that let you	79 79 79 79 79 79 79
shouldn ' I Be Without You Turn On Your	67 67 71 71 71 49 49 79 71
have some health complications	77 71 80 68
to see more videos	43 43 43 79
actors with it so yeah the main the main	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
which leads to sellers wanting to go on Amazon	52 79 79 79 73 64 64 67 67
20 or 30 actors that means for each	79 79 79 79 79 51 77 76
But then over time	67 67 67 67
other videos the first step to pursuing	79 79 79 71 71 71 70
fulfillment becomes more deeply embedded	0 1 1 1 0
say is always do a home inspection i	71 43 52 52 71 80 80 80
you on they get you off and your days	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 46 46
some of these smaller	68 67 67 41
three union background vouchers so if	68 68 68 71 68 68
part of the flooring the floors	79 79 79 79 79 71
comments below	53 53
and I thought that by maintaining eye contact it would show how	41 41 41 79 70 71 71 71 71 41 41 41
never be in a situation where you ' re in	19 40 40 31 70 70 19 19 19 19
lasting fulfillment and beyond that peak	79 70 49 49 76 79
you ' re going to find that an acting	50 50 50 50 80 71 71 80 70
acting is an evidence - based profession	40 40 40 70 70 70 70
your shoulders in building your career	71 41 68 71 49 49
build wealth and set yourself up for the	61 55 58 61 62 62 61 61
let ' s open it up to a wider pool of	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
want to pursue	79 79 79
business and i personally love it it ' s a	79 79 79 80 80 80 79 79 79 79
was vegan for some time it became a	41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41
to see if a	1 1 1 1
and interior design and all sorts of cool stuff	52 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 79
oh have I made money have I made money	31 49 49 49 49 70 49 43 43
But it ' s like 600 people out of an audience of 600	58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58 58
okay so i think there are two big	41 41 41 40 68 68 68 71
prove to an agent that you are taking	71 71 68 68 71 71 71 71
because you can teach things on Skillshare	40 40 40 41 41 23 50
really trust that person and they really	40 40 40 37 40 40 37
right now that ' s how you stand out from	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71
opportunities out there	41 41 41
And then you can start kind of killing some stuff	32 32 29 29 28 28 29 29 28 28
reps actors for stage work	71 80 49 40 70
with holding rental properties i just	79 79 79 70 40 40
and you ' re not in the UK where medical care is free	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 50 50 79
in that we have to do these boring fundamentals	79 79 76 76 76 79 79 79 76
happen to fit well then your chances are	76 76 76 76 76 50 71 71
haven ' t and I ' ll see you guys next time	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 70 70 70 70 79
thing that you write in the commercial	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
particular scenes of a project so you	49 52 52 52 49 49 49
it is very easy to get your license like	67 67 67 67 67 67 67 67 40
did we met was it at Sunwest Park but we	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49 49
this means they have no other income	33 40 79 79 52 52 43
like this will be a big factor in their	79 79 79 76 76 76 77 79 79
unfortunately the audition room is a far cry from a real restaurant	49 41 71 41 41 41 49 49 49 49 49 49
guys you	16 16
they ' re running a business and they	79 79 79 79 79 71 71 71
or a Nobel prize or to be a boxing champion	55 55 59 59 59 58 58 58 58 58
and then you can delegate outsource automate	63 63 63 63 63 63 63
this is super important because 8 by 10	0 0 0 79 79 79 79 79
it ' s okay if not everyone understands	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
and career advice every single week	68 41 71 71 41 41
in urban justice	79 79 79
the limitations of a small market	44 44 70 70 71 68
and do the things that you enjoy	41 41 41 49 49 49 49
may or may not be possible depending on	79 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
what ' s a good amount of time to be	49 49 49 49 49 49 49 50 49 79
why our job is not to book the role and	71 71 41 79 49 49 41 67 41 41
starting out doing commercials and	50 50 51 69 77
life to your cabinets and it ' s going to	79 79 70 79 79 79 79 79 52 52
possible while this certainly helps you	41 41 41 40 40 40
since I first came across this	67 70 70 70 67 67
logical order to cover things so first	40 40 40 40 41 41 41
name is alex collins and he talks about	41 41 41 41 41 68 68 68
is a waste of time for the most part	81 81 81 81 72 72 72 72 81
buy a home much sooner than if they were	70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70
your financials	79 79
is a little bit of luck to this	77 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
in the description below	71 79 79 21
financial reasons that it	50 80 80 80
many bedrooms which means that you can	79 79 49 40 40 40 40
the dreaded tell me about yourself	49 49 49 41 41 71
it really changed my mindset when it	76 76 77 73 67 76 70
can pretty much learn anything online	40 67 67 67 67 40
i do know actors that have spent over a	79 79 79 79 79 49 41 44 44
smaller market might cost a little bit	49 49 49 49 77 77 41
So it ' s not too hard to maintain that level of support	31 61 61 61 61 59 59 58 58 68 59 59 58
be playing the game that you have found yourself playing	79 79 76 76 79 79 79 79 79 79
out and buy a fancy camera for taping	53 53 53 53 53 53 71 71

but if maybe we ' re not entirely happy	67 67 67 0 0 0 1 1 0
throughout my career	79 79 79
if you ' d invested 10 years ago in Tesla	79 71 71 71 71 50 51 51 24 54
because if you cannot do it for you and	40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
