okay let's learn how to create an acting	49 49 49 41 41 41 71 71
all right here we're looking at my	19 0 0 0 0 0 0
current resume you can see the standard	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
three column format now i'm going to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
show you how to	0 0 0 0
make a resume like this regardless of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your experience level and we're gonna	0 0 0 0 0 0
start step by step	0 0 0 0
and build it piece by piece we're	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
starting with a blank resume the first	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
thing that you have is your name and big	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
bold letters right at the top it could	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
be left justified it could be centered	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it could be right justified i'll leave	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that up to you	0 0 0 0
i like having it on the left underneath	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your name should be your union status so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in the united states you are either a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
after a member in which case you would	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
write sag-aftra right down here	0 0 0 0 0
or you are non-union in which case you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
would write	0 0
non-union right here so remember this is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a film and television resume so if you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
an equity member for theater that	0 0 0 0 0 0
doesn't really apply here so you are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a sag-aftra member or you are non-union	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and that goes right underneath your name	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
underneath that should be your	0 0 0 0 0
statistics so i have my height	0 0 0 0 0 0
and then my hair color	0 0 0 0 0
and then my eye color	0 0 0 0 0
hair color and eye color are pretty	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
standard on a resume there is some	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
debate over whether or not to put your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
height i think it's fine because in the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
vast majority of auditions the casting	0 0 0 0 0 0
director asks you to slate your height	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so i don't think it's really that big of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a deal to put your height on your resume	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
some people	0 0
like to leave it off but i'll leave that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
up to you as well	0 0 0 0 0
underneath your statistics you have to	0 0 0 0 0 0
have your contact information	0 0 0 0
now if you have an agent you would put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your agent's contact information if you	0 0 0 0 0 0
don't have an agent you would just put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your own	0 0
so here we're assuming you don't have an	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
agent so you would put your own phone	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then an email address	0 0 0 0 0
your name at gmail.com whatever it is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
some people don't like to give out their	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
phone number in which case you can just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
have your email address but you really	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
need at least one or the	0 0 0 0 0 0
other because they have to have some way	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
of getting in touch with you if someone	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
looks at your resume and wants to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
get you an audition or wants to book you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for a project	0 0 0
they need to be able to get in touch	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
with you in some way shape or form	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you have a website you can put that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
here as well	0 0 0
so www.yourname.com whatever your	0 0 0 0
website is	0 0
okay so this is the standard top section	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
of a resume it needs to have your name	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it needs to have your union status	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it needs to have your stats and some way	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
of contacting you	0 0 0
all this information needs to be at the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
top of your resume remember if you have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
an agent then it has to be your agent's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
contact information	0 0
not your contact information you don't	0 0 0 0 0 0
need both you need	0 0 0 0
one or the other okay now let's get into	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the actual credits	0 0 0
section of your resume the first credit	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
section should be television credits	0 0 0 0 0
now if you don't have tv credits right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
now that's totally fine	0 0 0 0
everybody starts with zero credits right	0 0 0 0 0 0
but i want to make sure that you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
how to add a television credit to your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume when you do	0 0 0 0
i have full faith that you will at some	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
book a television show and now i'm going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to teach you how to add that credit	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to your resume now i'm going to put this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in bold i want to put all the title	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sections in bold	0 0 0
underneath this we're going to do this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
three column formatting now the first	0 0 0 0 0 0
column is the name of the show	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so let's say you book a role on stranger	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you would put the name of the show and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
then on the second column i'm going to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hit the tab	0 0 0
key on my computer to move over to a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
middle column so i'm going to hit it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
like three times and then here we would	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
put our billing	0 0 0
so for television shows your billing is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
either co-star guest star recurring	0 0 0 0 0
or series regular i'm not going to get	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
exactly what all of those means in this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
video because that would make this video	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
way too long	0 0 0
just understand that costar is a smaller	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
character guest star is a bigger	0 0 0 0 0 0
recurring means you're in multiple	0 0 0 0 0
episodes series regular is one of the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
lead characters of the show	0 0 0 0 0
how do you know what to put on your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume well that is dictated by the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so when you book a role on a television	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
show your contract will say if you are a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a guest star a recurring character or a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
series regular okay	0 0 0
so right now let's assume that you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
booked a role on stranger things and you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
were a co-star that's why we would write	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
co-star here in the	0 0 0 0
billing section and then we're gonna	0 0 0 0 0 0
move over three more tabs and the third	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and final column here is going to be the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
network name or the streaming service	0 0 0 0 0 0
in which case this will be netflix	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then i will also put the director	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so let's assume this was directed by the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
duffer brothers	0 0
who are the creators of stranger things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so that	0 0
is one line of a resume for the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
television section	0 0
we're gonna put one more line down here	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just so you can see how this works	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the walking dead for instance	0 0 0 0 0
and let's say for the walking dead you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
booked a guest star	0 0 0 0
and then the walking dead is on amc	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and let's say the director was greg	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay so those are two lines on a resume	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a television section i'm gonna add a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
couple more lines right here by just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
copying and pasting so it doesn't take	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
as long	0 0
but now you can see what the billing is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for co-star guest star recurring or	0 0 0 0 0 0
series regular	0 0
one thing that you'll notice is that for	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the recurring and series regular lines	0 0 0 0 0 0
we don't list the directors and that's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for most television shows the director	0 0 0 0 0 0
changes episode by episode so if you are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on multiple episodes you wouldn't have	0 0 0 0 0 0
room here to write 15 different	0 0 0 0 0 0
directors on this line	0 0 0 0
right so when you are a recurring	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
character or a series regular	0 0 0 0 0
you tend to leave that blank and just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
have the name of the	0 0 0 0 0
network or streaming service moving on	0 0 0 0 0 0
after television would be film	0 0 0 0 0
so again we're going to bold this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so here the formatting is exactly the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
same we're using the three columns	0 0 0 0 0 0
so assume we were in star wars	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
now for the second column of the film	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
section we don't use the same co-star	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
guest or recurring	0 0 0
stuff that we do for television because	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that doesn't make sense for a movie	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so here we write either lead supporting	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
or principle	0 0
i'll go into that in a second here let's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just finish off these three columns	0 0 0 0 0 0
the final column for the film section is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the name of the director	0 0 0 0 0
spelled his name wrong	0 0 0 0
so george lucas the name of the director	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for star wars now i'm going to add	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
a few more columns here by just copying	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and pasting	0 0
to save some time and then i'll explain	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what these sections are so here the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
first column is pretty self-explanatory	0 0 0 0 0
it's the name of the film	0 0 0 0 0 0
here like i said lead supporting or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so let's just use star wars as an	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
example the lead character	0 0 0 0
if you played luke skywalker in star	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
wars you would write lead on your resume	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you play a character like yoda	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
who is not the lead character but is a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
pretty important character in the movie	0 0 0 0 0 0
he is a big supporting character you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
would write supporting and	0 0 0 0
for principal principal is just any	0 0 0 0 0 0
other principle performer who isn't a	0 0 0 0 0 0
lead or a supporting character	0 0 0 0 0
continuing with the star wars example	0 0 0 0 0 0
one of the stormtroopers who has one	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
line and	0 0
then gets shot and killed he would just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
be a principal performer in the movie	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then finally the last column is the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
name of the director so as we see	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
our four credits here we have star wars	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
lee george lucas black panther	0 0 0 0 0
supporting ryan coogler	0 0 0
lore principal kate shortland and then	0 0 0 0 0 0
this final line in the film section i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
want to show you how you can add a short	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you were in a short film you would	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
also put it in the film section you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
would just put	0 0 0
short in parentheses this is the way	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they do it on imdb so i just copied that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so assume you were in a short film	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
called tiny dinosaurs you would put it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on your resume like this if you were the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
lead character and then	0 0 0 0
and then the name of the director is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ellie sattler hey if you're getting	0 77 77 77 77 77

this template	71 76
and if you have any questions remember	76 76 76 76 76 49 41
to ask them down in the comments below	71 71 71 71 71 71 71 67
alright let's get back to it now one	68 79 79 19 0 0 0 0
important thing to understand	0 0 0 0
for an acting resume is that background	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
work does not	0 0 0
go on an acting resume if you were	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
background in a movie or you are an	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
extra on a television show you do not	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
put this	0 0
on an acting resume so i do not want to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
see any resumes that say	0 0 0 0 0
for instance game of thrones background	0 0 0 0 0 0
okay i know a lot of people are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
desperate to	0 0
show experience on their resume to	0 0 0 0 0 0
look more like a professional but it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actually gonna have	0 0 0
the opposite effect if you put	0 0 0 0 0 0
background work on your acting resume it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
makes you look	0 0 0
unprofessional because it looks like you	0 0 0 0 0 0
don't know what you're doing	0 0 0 0 0
professional actors understand that	0 0 0 0
background work does not go	0 0 0 0 0
on an acting resume all right moving on	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to the next section	0 0 0 0
is web series these are the types of	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
credits that most people will start off	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
with these are the things that you shoot	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
with your friends these are the things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that you shoot with	0 0 0 0
people in acting class you write your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
own projects you produce your own	0 0 0 0 0 0
you film them and then you edit them	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and then you put them up on youtube or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
instagram or facebook or wherever	0 0 0 0 0
but these are just like independent	0 0 0 0 0 0
shows that don't go	0 0 0 0
to a major network so let's assume you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
created a web series called	0 0 0 0 0
the white house and then we would use	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the same type of billing that you use	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in a television show so i'm gonna put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
guest star	0 0
and then we would put the director so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
let's say the director's name was donna	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so if you were in a web series that you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
created with your friends that you put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
up on youtube you can put this on your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume this is	0 0 0
the right way to add credits to your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume and not	0 0 0
use background work now the next section	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is theater	0 0
a lot of people will start out in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
theater before they move into film and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
tv so this is something that you can put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your resume even though it is a film and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
tv resume having theater credits stuff	0 0 0 0 0 0
does add some credibility so let's say	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you were in	0 0 0
uh a couple shows i'm gonna copy and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
paste again so it doesn't take as long	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to type	0 0
so let's say you were in a couple shows	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
romeo and juliet you play juliet little	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
women you played amy	0 0 0 0
the three columns here are again the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
name of the play	0 0 0 0
here you would write your character this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is the only time on an acting resume	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
where you actually write your character	0 0 0 0 0 0
look at the television film and web	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
series credits you actually write your	0 0 0 0 0 0
billing co-star guest or recurring	0 0 0 0 0
series regular lead supporting principal	0 0 0 0 0
lead guest star	0 0 0
right in theater is the only time where	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you actually write the name of the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
character the third column in the	0 0 0 0 0 0
theater section	0 0
is the place where the production was	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
put up so	0 0 0
if you did the show in school you would	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
write the name of your school in this	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
case i put the university of arizona	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you did it in a local theater you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
write for instance big house theater or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
whatever the name of the theater was	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
that you actually did the play now one	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
thing that i want to mention with	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
theater is that a lot of people have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
done plays since they were very young	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
they've done plays since they were in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
elementary school	0 0
through middle school through high	0 0 0 0 0
school through college and beyond and in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
those cases they may have	0 0 0 0 0
30 40 or more credits	0 0 0 0 0
there can be a desire to put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all of those credits onto your acting	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume and shrink the font so it all	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
fits onto one page i want you to not do	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because that also makes you look	0 0 0 0 0 0
i get the feeling of wanting to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
show off that you've done so much work	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
but it doesn't look that great when you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
try to squeeze	0 0 0
everything onto one page of a resume it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actually looks	0 0
so desperate so what i would say is cut	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it down to your	0 0 0 0
best five or eight roles and put those	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
under that section and maybe just next	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to it right	0 0 0
partial list if you look over at my	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i've done more tv shows than what's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
listed here i've done more movies than	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what's listed here but i don't squeeze	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
them all	0 0
onto my resume just to make it look	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i limit it to less than 10 on each	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
section and then i write	0 0 0 0 0
partial list right next to it just so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
people understand that there	0 0 0 0
are more credits i just don't list	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
everything okay	0 0
so that's the same thing that you should	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
do for the theater section of your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume in case you have	0 0 0 0 0
many many credits moving on the next	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
section is commercials	0 0 0
can't spell commercials all right so	0 0 0 0 0 0
the most important thing to know here is	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
industry standard is to only write	0 0 0 0 0 0
available upon	0 0
request and that's it this is the only	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
thing that you write in the commercial	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
section of a resume	0 0 0 0
the rule of thumb is to not list your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actual commercial credits on your acting	0 0 0 0 0 0
the reason being if you go into a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
commercial audition	0 0
let's say it's for burger king and then	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you hand them your resume and you did a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
mcdonald's commercial	0 0
a few years ago and that's on your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume the person that works at burger	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
king may look at that	0 0 0 0 0
and decide that they don't want to hire	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you simply because	0 0 0
you have done a commercial for competing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
product even if that commercial isn't on	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the air anymore	0 0 0
so this is why you typically just write	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
conflicts available upon request	0 0 0 0
on this section now one thing that you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
can do is	0 0 0
let's say you have 10 or 15 commercials	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
instead of writing that you could write	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
something like 10 plus credits or	0 0 0 0 0 0
if you look over at my resume i write	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
regional and local 40 plus credits all	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so you could write something like that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you have commercial credits	0 0 0 0 0
now one thing that you might do is that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you are submitting your acting resume	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
just to get an	0 0 0 0
agent and you have some commercial	0 0 0 0 0 0
credits maybe at that point is a time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
when you do list your credits on your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume just so they can see	0 0 0 0 0 0
what you've done but when you go to an	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actual audition for a commercial	0 0 0 0 0
you wouldn't put those on there that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
make sense okay moving on	0 0 0 0 0
the next section is training	0 0 0 0 0
this is the single most important	0 0 0 0 0 0
section of your resume	0 0 0 0
when you are starting out i've asked my	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
agent this	0 0
on what she looks for when someone	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
submits to her agency	0 0 0 0
and she says that if they don't already	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
have film and television credits	0 0 0 0 0
then the first thing that she looks at	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is training to make sure that they are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
trying to improve themselves	0 0 0 0
as actors and that they are trying to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
stay on top of their craft	0 0 0 0 0 0
and that they are really serious about	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
making it in this industry so i've said	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it in so many other videos and i'm going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to say it again	0 0 0 0
acting classes are so vital to your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so make sure that you have training that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you can put on your resume	0 0 0 0 0 0
i'm going to copy and paste again so it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
doesn't take as much time	0 0 0 0 0
to type all right	0 0 0 0
so the way that you would put training	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you would use again the same three	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
column format here if you have a theater	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
degree from college you would put	0 0 0 0 0 0
for instance bfa musical theater you put	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the name of	0 0 0
or the year that you got it and then the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
name of the school where you got your	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if you took classes in a in an acting	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
studio you would put	0 0 0 0
the name of the class let's say the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
meisner technique	0 0
the name of the teacher sanford meisner	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and the name of the school the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
neighborhood playhouse	0 0
or if let's say it was on camera class	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you would write that name of the teacher	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
meryl streep	0 0
and the yale school of drama i'm pretty	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sure meryl streep doesn't actually teach	0 0 0 0 0 0
an on-camera class so don't go looking	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for it	0 0
okay moving on to the last section which	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is called	0 0
special skills not just skill skills	0 0 0 0 0 0
there we go	0 0 0
this is something that some productions	0 0 0 0 0 0
will look for	0 0 0
in case they need a character to be able	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to perform a certain thing on set	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for example let's say that a character	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is a college basketball player	0 0 0 0 0
well they're going to need that actor to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
at least look competent in basketball	0 0 0 0 0 0
and look believable in a college	0 0 0 0 0 0
basketball game	0 0
so this is where you would put those	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
types of skills whether you are skilled	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in some sort of sports or	0 0 0 0 0 0
other things one of the most important	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ones is	0 0
languages so if you were let's say	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
in spanish you would write that	0 0 0 0 0 0
here and then other skills that you may	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i'm going to copy and paste	0 0 0 0 0 0
you might have swing dance experience or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
horseback riding or you can drive manual	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
transmission or you play roller hockey	0 0 0 0 0 0
or soccer baseball football all these	0 0 0 0 0 0
okay so these are all the things that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you can add to your skill section	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
of a resume and that is pretty much it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
look at this resume that we've just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
built you don't	0 0 0
have to have all of these sections when	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you just start out	0 0 0 0
when you're just starting out you	0 0 0 0 0 0
probably won't have any television or	0 0 0 0 0 0
film credits right so we're just going	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
to delete that right now	0 0 0 0 0
you might have some web series and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
theater you'll have	0 0 0
some training and then you will have	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your special skills	0 0 0
if your resume looks like this and it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
not completely	0 0
filled in like mine is that's totally	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
because we all start from somewhere my	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
resume looked like this when i first	0 0 0 0 0 0 0
